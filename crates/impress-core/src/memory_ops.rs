//! The memory kernel — write, gate, rank and recall suite-scoped memory.
//!
//! The three schemas in [`crate::schemas::memory`] say what a memory *is*.
//! This module is everything the suite does *with* one, and it lives here for
//! the same reason [`crate::watched_folder_ops`] does: the agent-facing verbs
//! (`#[impress_service]`), the Swift façade (`impress-store-ffi`) and a
//! headless `cargo test` must all drive the identical logic, and the only
//! place all three can reach without dragging the MCP machinery into every app
//! binary is the kernel crate.
//!
//! The primitives, and how a caller composes them (`remember` is the
//! service-level verb a caller writes; this module supplies its two halves and
//! deliberately does not choose between them on the caller's behalf):
//!
//! ```text
//!   remember ──► gate_fts ──► Insert  ──► insert_memory_item ──► ItemId
//!                    └──────► Confirm ──► confirm(existing)
//!   recall   ──► search_all ──► head filter ──► rank_memory_candidates
//!   brief    ──► recall × 3 (instructions, claims, episodes)
//! ```
//!
//! # Writing: [`insert_memory_item`]
//!
//! One flat payload (`title`, `body`, `claim_type`, … as top-level keys — NOT
//! a `{title, data, body}` nesting), `Visibility::Private`, `version` pinned to
//! the schema's, and the D39 field/edge pair written together: `subject_refs`
//! becomes `RelatesTo` edges, `evidence_refs` becomes `DerivedFrom`,
//! `agent_run_ref` becomes `ProducedBy`.
//!
//! A ref that does not resolve to a live item is **skipped for the edge and
//! kept in the payload**. The payload records what the author asserted; the
//! graph records what is actually there. Failing the whole write because one
//! evidence id was stale would mean an agent loses a true memory over a
//! bookkeeping detail, and silently dropping it from the payload too would
//! erase the only trace that the author believed it.
//!
//! [`MemoryDraft::deterministic_key`] is the idempotency seam. With a key, the
//! id is `UUIDv5(`[`MEMORY_NAMESPACE`]`, key)`, so a writer that runs twice —
//! a retried consolidation pass, a re-imported transcript — produces one row,
//! and the second call returns the existing id **without modifying it**.
//!
//! # The dedup gate: [`gate_fts`]
//!
//! Memory's characteristic failure is not forgetting; it is remembering the
//! same thing 40 times in slightly different words, until recall returns forty
//! paraphrases and nothing else fits in the context window. [`gate_fts`] is
//! the Tier-1 defence: before inserting, look for a near-duplicate by
//! full-text search, score token overlap, and if something is close enough
//! **confirm it instead** ([`confirm`] bumps `confirmations` and stamps
//! `last_confirmed`). A memory seen twice is one memory with more evidence
//! behind it, and [`rank_memory_candidates`] rewards it accordingly.
//!
//! What this tier deliberately does NOT do is decide that a new memory
//! *contradicts* an old one and supersede it automatically. Detecting "the
//! flux column is in mJy" versus "the flux column is in Jy" is a semantic
//! judgement — the two sentences have near-identical token sets, and any
//! threshold that catches the contradiction also merges them. So supersession
//! stays an explicit verb ([`supersede`]) driven by the LLM tier or a human,
//! and this gate only ever chooses between *insert* and *confirm*, both of
//! which are safe when wrong.
//!
//! # Reading: [`recall`] and [`brief`]
//!
//! [`recall`] composes FTS retrieval with three filters that are not
//! negotiable — superseded memories are not returned (that is what
//! supersession *means*), `no_recall` rows are withheld, and an optional
//! subject filter narrows to memories about one item — and then scores what
//! survives with [`rank_memory_candidates`].
//!
//! [`brief`] is the "start of session" shape: instructions first (they bind
//! regardless of topic), then claims (topic-scoped when a topic is given),
//! then recent episodes.
//!
//! # Ranking is a pure function
//!
//! [`rank_memory_candidates`] takes a slice and returns scores. No store, no
//! clock — `now_ms` is a parameter — so it is testable, reproducible and
//! reviewable as the *product decision* about what makes a memory worth
//! surfacing. Ties break on ascending id, the same discipline
//! `search_ops::rank_hybrid_candidates` is pinned to: without it the same
//! corpus ranks two ways between calls and no golden test can exist.
