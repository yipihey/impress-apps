//! Why a verb did not do what it was asked, in a form a program can branch on.
//!
//! Every result envelope the layout and surface services return carries `ok`
//! and a prose `message`. Before wave 7 a refusal was ONLY prose, so an agent,
//! a script or the Swift host could not tell "no such pane" from "the store is
//! not open" without matching English (review RL-L11, AC-F19). A refusal now
//! also carries a stable, kebab-case `code`:
//!
//! * the **domain** codes are the serde tags the refusing type already has —
//!   `impress_layout::LayoutError`'s `unknown-tile`, `no-pane-with-role`,
//!   `cannot-close-last-pane`, …; `impress_surface::ReduceError`'s
//!   `unknown-widget`, `not-bindable`, … — so the vocabulary is written down
//!   once, where the refusal is decided;
//! * the **generic** codes below cover what no domain type decides: a
//!   malformed argument, a missing record, a lost race, a store that is not
//!   there.
//!
//! [`http_status`] is the one mapping from a code to an HTTP status, so a
//! route never infers a status from message text again.
