//! Report types for a service's self-test.
//!
//! One copy, used by `impress-layout-service` and `impress-surface-service`
//! (each re-exports this module as its own `report`). They were two
//! field-for-field copies until review RS-S21; this crate is the one both
//! already depend on, and it needs nothing but serde for them.
//!
//! `imprint-selftest` still keeps its own, older shape: it has no `ok` field,
//! so moving it here would change what its `run-selftest` answers.
