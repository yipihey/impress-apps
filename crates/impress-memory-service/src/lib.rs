//! `MemoryService` — the agent-facing surface of the suite memory kernel
//! (ADR-0028, `docs/ADR-0028-memory-kernel.md`).
//!
//! Every `#[impress_method]` here is a thin wrapper over
//! `impress_core::memory_ops`: this crate converts arguments, maps the
//! kernel's types to DTOs, and turns errors into `ok: false` plus the
//! kernel's own message — the same shape `impress-store-service`'s
//! `TriageService` and `StoreQueryService` use, and for the same reason: no
//! domain logic lives here, so the CLI, MCP and impel all call the identical
//! behaviour a headless `cargo test` already proves.
//!
//! **Two tiers, one always on.** The FTS tier (full-text dedup gate,
//! full-text retrieval, the deterministic ranker) is always live and needs
//! nothing configured. The vector tier (ADR-0028 D6) is opt-in — set
//! `IMPRESS_MEMORY_VECTORS=1` — and COMPOSES with the FTS tier rather than
//! replacing it, per the kernel's own module docs
//! (`memory_ops::MemoryCandidate::vector_similarity`): `remember`'s dedup
//! gate runs FTS first and only falls to the (higher-threshold) vector check
//! when FTS found nothing; `recall` re-ranks the SAME page FTS already
//! selected rather than widening it. [`DefaultMemoryService::memory_status`]
//! reports which tier is actually running — see its own doc for the exact
//! states — rather than a static claim either way.
//!
//! The vector tier is lazy and process-wide: it is built at most once, on
//! the first `remember` or `recall` call after the env var is read as `"1"`,
//! and any failure to build it (missing sidecar, model load failure) turns
//! it off for the rest of the process with one `stderr` line — imitating
//! `impress-mcp::tools::SEMANTIC_UNAVAILABLE`'s degraded-mode discipline.
//! `memory_status` never triggers that build (it would pay for a
//! `SemanticSearch` model load just to answer a status query); it only ever
//! peeks at whatever state already exists and opens the sidecar (cheaply,
//! read-only in effect) to count vectors.
//!
//! # Attribution
//!
//! Every write this service makes is stamped `author: "impress-memory-service"`,
//! `author_kind: `[`ActorKind::System`]. None of the trait methods take an
//! author argument — a caller may be a human at the CLI, an MCP client, or an
//! impel agent, and the service has no reliable way to tell which — so, like
//! `impress-store-service`'s own automated writers
//! (`docs_import_service::new_manuscript`, `source_service::put_*`), it
//! attributes its writes to itself rather than guessing. This mirrors, not
//! invents, the established convention for a service-authored write in this
//! crate family.
