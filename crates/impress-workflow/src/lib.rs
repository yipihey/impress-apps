//! W1 (plan-self-reflective-layer.md): the workflow spec, its validator and
//! its pure planner — `pure` tier (`docs/kit-manifest.md`).
//!
//! A workflow (`impress/workflow@1.0.0`) is a stored, reviewable action
//! sequence: a trigger instead of a widget, the surface action vocabulary
//! for its `steps` (reused, never forked — WF-2), guards and review
//! metadata (D-R6). This crate owns:
//!
//! - [`spec`] — [`spec::WorkflowSpec`], [`spec::Trigger`], [`spec::Guards`],
//!   [`spec::Review`], serde + (behind `schema`) `JsonSchema`.
//! - [`validate::validate`] — every structural and workflow-only problem a
//!   spec can have.
//! - [`plan::plan`] — given one trigger event already fired, what the
//!   workflow's steps do: `impress_surface::reduce` over a synthetic
//!   single-node spec, returning the same `Effect`s a surface's own
//!   `reduce` would (a `Call` is returned, never executed here).
//!
//! - [`trigger::tick`] (W2) — pure: `(enabled workflows, clock, signals) ->
//!   which fire right now`, with the `start_delay` startup rule built in.
//!
//! **No I/O, no store, no async, no verb inventory.** A host resolving
//! store/job/call signals and running a fired workflow's steps through the
//! pipeline is `impress-workflow-service` (a sibling `store`-tier crate) and
//! its two hosts (`impel-taskd`, the app's FFI tick) — this crate decides,
//! it never fetches or calls.
