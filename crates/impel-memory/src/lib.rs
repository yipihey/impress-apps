//! ADR-0028 D7 — the memory kernel's two task-kernel executors, and the
//! spawner that keeps them fed.
//!
//! Both are ordinary [`impel_core::TaskExecutor`]s, so everything the ADR-0005
//! §6 loop already provides (readiness gating, acquire/retry/escalate, the
//! operation-journal retry ledger) applies unchanged, and neither executor
//! touches task state — that is the scheduler's exclusive job.
//!
//! * [`EmbedBackfillExecutor`] (`impress.memory.embed`) — one bounded window of
//!   embedding work per task, over memory items and `content-chunk@1.0.0`,
//!   written into the `impress-embeddings` sidecar.
//! * [`MemoryConsolidationExecutor`] (`impress.memory.consolidate`) — one
//!   bounded time window of terminal `agent-run@1.0.0` items per task, distilled
//!   into `memory/episode@1.0.0` rows through the D6 dedup gate.
//! * [`plan_memory_tasks`] — called once per taskd pass; spawns at most one task
//!   of each kind, deduped on open state and cooled off after failure.
//!
//! # Why both executors hold an `Arc<SqliteItemStore>`
//!
//! [`impel_core::TaskStoreApi`] is deliberately narrow: it is the *kernel*
//! surface (get/create/apply/add_edge/record_agent_run/transition), not a query
//! surface. These executors need `query`, `query_raw` and
//! [`impress_core::memory_ops`], none of which are on it, so they take the same
//! concrete store the scheduler runs against — exactly what
//! `impress_ai::AiStore` does for the inference executors in the same daemon.
//! Kernel writes still go through the `&dyn TaskStoreApi` handed to `execute`,
//! so provenance and attribution stay on the one path.
//!
//! # Idempotency is the executor's job, not the scheduler's
//!
//! `Scheduler::run_once`'s resume pass re-executes any task left `running` by a
//! crash. Both executors are therefore replay-safe by construction rather than
//! by bookkeeping: the embed executor's vector ids are a pure function of
//! `(source_id, model)` so a re-run is an UPSERT over the same rows, and the
//! consolidation executor's memory rows carry a `deterministic_key` derived
//! from the source run id so a re-run resolves to the same UUIDv5 and returns
//! the existing row untouched.
