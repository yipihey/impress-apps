//! `StoreQueryService` — grouped global search, cross-kind relations, and
//! generic get/browse (ADR-0022 D6 / D8 / D5-G6).
//!
//! The reads that only make sense over the *whole* store. Everything else an
//! agent can ask for is scoped to one record kind and lives in that kind's app
//! service; these exist precisely because the answer is mixed-kind:
//!
//! * [`StoreQueryService::search_all`] — one FTS query over `items_fts`, which
//!   already indexes every kind, returning `schema_ref` on every hit so the
//!   caller buckets by kind (D6).
//! * [`StoreQueryService::related_items`] — the typed edge graph walked in both
//!   directions across all edge types, so a task can name the message that
//!   produced it and a figure can name the manuscript that embeds it (D8).
//! * [`StoreQueryService::get_item`] — the envelope of ONE item of any kind,
//!   plus its payload, so the thing a search hit named can actually be read
//!   without knowing which app owns it.
//! * [`StoreQueryService::list_items`] — a page of envelopes for one kind (or
//!   every kind), so the store can be *browsed* rather than only searched.
//!
//! The first two delegate to `impress_core::{search_ops, related_ops}`. The
//! last two are envelope projections over `ItemStore::get` plus one ordering
//! query; like the other services in this crate, no domain logic lives here —
//! it converts arguments, maps rows to DTOs, and turns errors into `ok: false`
//! plus the kernel's own message.
