//! `TaskExecutor` — the ADR-0005 §7 execution contract (ADR-0015 D5).
//!
//! Replaces the earlier synchronous string-in/string-out stub (which had
//! no implementors). One refinement over the ADR's literal signature:
//! `execute` returns [`ExecutionOutcome`] instead of `()`, because the
//! §8 `AwaitHumanResponse` checkpoint needs a way for an executor to say
//! "I opened a review and am suspending" that `Ok(())` cannot express.
//! The scheduler treats `Suspended` by leaving the task `running`
//! (ADR-0005 §8) and re-invoking `execute` after the review resolves —
//! executors re-derive their state from the graph on resume (ADR-0005
//! "Mitigations": re-run task setup rather than serialize executor state).
