//! ADR-0033 surface verbs, store records and runtime (`docs/plan-agent-surfaces.md`
//! work package S4).
//!
//! # What this crate adds to `impress-surface`
//!
//! `crates/impress-surface` is pure: a [`impress_surface::SurfaceSpec`] is a
//! value, `plan`/`resolve`/`reduce` are value → value functions, and none of
//! it touches a store or calls a verb. This crate is the other half:
//!
//! 1. **Persistence** ([`store`]) — a surface's spec is an
//!    `impress/ui/surface@1.0.0` row; its working state and the events it
//!    emits are `impress/ui/surface-state@1.0.0` /
//!    `impress/ui/surface-event@1.0.0` rows, written through the store's
//!    operation path exactly as the layout tree's rows are (ADR-0033 D5).
//! 2. **Execution** ([`runtime`]) — an [`runtime::Executor`] that runs a
//!    source's verb through the linked `#[impress_service]` inventory
//!    (ADR-0033 D4) or a query through the store, and a
//!    [`runtime::SurfaceRuntime`] that holds one `(surface, host)`
//!    instance's state/params/source-cache between calls, in a
//!    [`runtime::SessionRegistry`] shaped like the layout tree's own.
//! 3. **Reach** ([`service`]) — one `#[impress_method]` per verb, so MCP,
//!    the CLI and impel's agent loop get the whole five-verb loop
//!    (`surface_schema` → author → `surface_validate` → `surface_create` →
//!    `surface_show` → `surface_wait` → react) together.
//!
//! # The cut, in one line
//!
//! Nothing here decides anything about what a spec MEANS. Every verb either
//! reads/writes a store row unchanged, or hands a value to
//! `impress-surface`'s pure functions and stores what comes back. When
//! something about the VOCABULARY is wrong, it is wrong in
//! `crates/impress-surface`; when something about persistence, execution or
//! reach is wrong, it is wrong here.
