//! `SurfaceSelftestService` — the capability catalogue through the codegen
//! pipeline, so `run_selftest` shows up as the MCP tool
//! `surface-selftest-service_run-selftest` and as a CLI subcommand with no
//! hand-written glue — mirroring `impress-layout-service::LayoutSelftestService`
//! exactly (including the tool-name precedent: neither trait's kebab name
//! carries an `impress-` prefix, unlike `ImpressSurfaceService` itself, whose
//! prefix `docs/agent-surfaces.md` fixes explicitly).
//!
//! Confirming a surface capability works must not require clicking a GUI —
//! the same rule `imprint-selftest` and `impress-layout-service`'s own
//! catalogue already keep.
