//! The impure half of a surface: running its sources through the linked
//! `#[impress_service]` inventory and the store, and turning what the human
//! did into effects that actually happen (ADR-0033 D2/D4).
//!
//! [`impress_surface`] is pure — `plan`/`resolve`/`reduce` never touch a
//! store or call a verb themselves. This module is the other half: an
//! [`Executor`] that CAN, a [`SurfaceRuntime`] that holds one surface
//! instance's live state (spec, state, params, source cache) between calls,
//! and a [`SessionRegistry`] that holds one of those per `(surface, host)` —
//! the same shape `impress-layout-service/src/session.rs` gives the layout
//! tree, for the same reason: a process-wide table, one entry per scope,
//! created on first touch.
//!
//! # Where the linked inventory is reached
//!
//! `impress-capabilities` is the one crate meant to link every
//! `#[impress_service]` trait — but this crate cannot depend on it (nor on
//! `impress-capabilities-kit`): both already depend on
//! `impress-surface-service` itself, and a dependency back would be a cycle.
//! [`call_verb`] therefore runs through `impress_service_core::call`, the one
//! copy of "find the descriptor, run its handler" both of those re-export
//! (review RS-S21), and only maps its error onto a [`Refusal`].
