//! V1 (wave 5, ADR-0033 D4 amendment 2026-09-23): the host verb bridge.
//!
//! A surface rendered in the app can only call the four kit crates' verbs
//! through this crate's own linked `#[impress_service]` inventory. Wave 5
//! gives the executor and the service a second, host-supplied inventory —
//! [`impress_surface_service::VerbHost`] — consulted only when the linked
//! one lacks the name. These tests exercise that bridge with a fake host
//! that knows exactly one verb, against a real in-memory store, through the
//! same `DefaultImpressSurfaceService`/`DefaultExecutor` the app and MCP
//! both use.
