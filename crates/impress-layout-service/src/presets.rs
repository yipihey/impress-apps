//! The shipped presets, as a data table and as store rows (ADR-0031 D10,
//! work package L7 of `docs/plan-layout-tree.md`).
//!
//! > An app preset is a set of named queries, a default tree, and a role
//! > assignment. imbib is "the publication queries with the triage layout";
//! > imprint is "the manuscript queries with the writing layout".
//!
//! That sentence is this module. [`shipped_presets`] is the table — one
//! [`ShippedPreset`] per `(app, purpose)` — and [`PresetStore`] is the half
//! that puts it in the store, because **presets are records the user can
//! edit**, not Rust constants. The table is only the *shipped* revision: it
//! seeds a row that is absent and is otherwise never written over, which is
//! what makes [`PresetStore::ensure_shipped`] safe to call on every launch
//! and what makes `reset_preset` a verb rather than the default behaviour.
//!
//! # What the table reproduces
//!
//! Today's chassis, per app, is `AppShellConfiguration.<app>`: a set of
//! visible sections, a default section, and a default detail tab. Each app's
//! **default** preset is that configuration as a tree —
//!
//! * the **navigator** pane is the outline over the navigable kinds
//!   (`collection` + `library`), which is the sidebar as a pane like any
//!   other (D1);
//! * the **list** pane is the app's `defaultSection` query;
//! * the **detail** pane is `item(id = $item)` rendered by the app's
//!   `defaultDetailTab` — the `DetailTab` raw values (`info`, `source`,
//!   `pdf`, `notes`, `bibtex`) are the view-kind spellings, so the Swift
//!   `ViewKindRegistry` resolves the tab it already has;
//!
//! shares 1 : 2 : 3, roles `navigator` / `list` / `detail`, focus on the
//! list (the pane the triage grammar acts on).
//!
//! and [`named_queries`] carries **every section** of that app's
//! `visibleSections` as a [`PaneQuery`], so the preset says what the app can
//! show, not merely what it opens on. The sections that are not values in the
//! algebra are named in [`MATERIALIZE_FIRST`], with the reason, per ADR-0031
//! D2 — a section that is missing from both lists is a bug, and
//! `every_visible_section_is_accounted_for` is the test that says so.
//!
//! # Hiding a pane
//!
//! `PaneLayoutState`'s three Booleans (`sidebarVisible`, `listPaneVisible`,
//! `detailPaneVisible`) become shares, and "hidden" is [`HIDDEN_SHARE`] —
//! **not** `0.0`, which the tree refuses and `normalize` rewrites to a full
//! column. [`impress_layout::shares`] is where that constant lives and why;
//! Triage and Reading below are the presets that use it, and a hidden pane
//! keeps its query, its role and its session, so ⌘0 / ⌥⌘0 / ⌃⌘S are a
//! `resize` back rather than a close and a re-split.
