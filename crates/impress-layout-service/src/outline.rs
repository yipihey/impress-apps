//! The outline sidebar as decisions (plan wave 6, W3 — L8 leaf 4).
//!
//! The navigator pane of every preset is an `outline` pane. What it DRAWS is
//! the chassis sidebar — the same rows, the same counts, the same context
//! menus — because the Swift host renders the sidebar the chassis already
//! has rather than a second one. What it DOES when a row is selected is this
//! module: a row becomes an [`OutlineNode`], [`outline_target`] says which
//! pane query (or which legacy route) that node is, and [`outline_verbs`]
//! says which D8 verbs retarget the `list` pane to it. Swift applies the verbs
//! and decides nothing (the plan's "Rust decides with a test; Swift maps").
//!
//! # Three answers, never a guess
//!
//! * [`OutlineTarget::Query`] — the node is a value in the algebra. The list
//!   pane's query becomes it by `set-query` (or `set-pane` when the pane is
//!   not a `list` right now), and the detail pane follows the channel as it
//!   always did.
//! * [`OutlineTarget::Legacy`] — the node is NOT a value in the algebra: one
//!   of [`crate::MATERIALIZE_FIRST`]'s five sections, or a route whose query
//!   would lie (a task's lifecycle is `payload.state`, which `Filter::Status`
//!   does not read). The list pane becomes a `legacy` pane scoped to THAT
//!   route — `view_state` names the section and the node, so the host renders
//!   one section's route and never the whole chassis. The reason travels with
//!   it, because this is the materialization work that remains and it is
//!   recorded where it happens rather than hidden.
//! * [`OutlineTarget::Inert`] — the node navigates nowhere in this app. No
//!   verb is sent, and the reason is logged.
//!
//! # Which sections an app has
//!
//! [`outline_sections`] is the app's section table: its named queries (the
//! `SidebarSectionType` cases of `presets::named_queries`) plus the
//! [`crate::MATERIALIZE_FIRST`] sections the app shows. The Swift outline
//! shows exactly these sections; a section the chassis would show and this
//! table does not name is dropped and logged, never drawn.
