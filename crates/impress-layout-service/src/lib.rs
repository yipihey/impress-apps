//! The ADR-0031 D8 verbs, as an `#[impress_service]` trait over a store-backed
//! layout tree (work package L3 of `docs/plan-layout-tree.md`).
//!
//! # What this crate adds to `impress-layout`
//!
//! `crates/impress-layout` is pure: a [`Layout`](impress_layout::Layout) is a
//! value, every gesture is a [`Verb`](impress_layout::Verb), and applying one
//! returns a patch that reverts exactly. It has no I/O by design, which is
//! what makes the whole model testable with no app running.
//!
//! This crate is the other half — the three things a pure tree cannot do:
//!
//! 1. **Persistence.** The live arrangement of every `(app_id, device)` scope
//!    is an `impress/ui/layout@1.0.0` row ([`store`]), written through the
//!    store's operation path so it is attributed, intent-bearing and tiered:
//!    `Ephemeral` for the gestures, `Durable` for the commits (ADR-0019 D2/D6,
//!    ADR-0031 D7).
//! 2. **Continuity.** The undo rings are in-memory per scope ([`session`]),
//!    because a ring is a record of *this* sitting and restoring one from a
//!    file would let ⌘Z revert a gesture made on another device last week.
//! 3. **Reach.** One `#[impress_method]` per verb ([`service`]), so MCP, the
//!    CLI and impel's agent loop get split / move / retype / re-link / save /
//!    recall together — invariant 6 of ADR-0031: no Swift-only layout
//!    operation.
//!
//! # The cut, in one line
//!
//! Nothing here decides anything about the tree. Every verb builds an
//! `impress_layout::Verb`, hands it to the pure applier, and stores what comes
//! back. When something about *layout* is wrong, it is wrong in
//! `impress-layout`; when something about *durability or attribution* is
//! wrong, it is wrong here.
//!
//! # Reading the results
//!
//! Every verb answers with `focused` and `affected_panes` — the focused leaf
//! and the panes to redraw. That pair is the renderer's whole input, and it is
//! why a Swift host can walk this tree without holding layout state of its own
//! (ADR-0019 D3).
