//! `LayoutService` — every ADR-0031 D8 verb, as an `#[impress_method]`.
//!
//! One trait, one method per gesture, so MCP, the CLI and impel's agent loop
//! get split / move / retype / re-link / save / recall together and nobody
//! keeps a translation table in their head (invariant 6: every layout gesture
//! is a `layout-service` verb; no Swift-only layout operation).
//!
//! # The shape every verb has
//!
//! * `app_id` — which preset family this window belongs to (`imbib`,
//!   `imprint`, …). It scopes the live row and the saved layouts.
//! * `device` — `null` means *this* device; see [`crate::device`].
//! * a **pane reference** ([`PaneRefDto`]) where the verb acts on a pane:
//!   by tile id, by role, by direction from the focused leaf, or the focused
//!   leaf itself. Resolution happens once, in Rust.
//! * `actor` — `human` | `agent` | `system`, defaulting to **agent**, because
//!   these verbs arrive over MCP and the CLI and an agent that forgets to say
//!   who it is must not be recorded as the user. The GUI passes `human`.
//!
//! and every result carries `focused` and `affected_panes`, which is the whole
//! of what a renderer needs to know what to redraw.
//!
//! # The written contract (plan wave 7 T6)
//!
//! * **Strict arguments.** An argument object is checked against the
//!   method's input schema (`strict_args` below): a field it does not name is
//!   `invalid-argument` naming it. A pane reference has one spelling (see
//!   [`PaneRefDto`]).
//! * **Versioned, revisioned results.** Every envelope carries
//!   `wire_version`; verbs and `get_layout` carry the live row's `revision`,
//!   and a verb that moves the live tree takes `expected_revision`, refused
//!   `conflict` when it went stale.
//! * **Reads and the cold start (review RL-L15, decided).** A read that finds
//!   no live row writes one, and over MCP and the CLI that write is
//!   attributed to the **agent** whose read caused it. The read verbs take no
//!   `actor` argument, on purpose: an agent must not be able to record itself
//!   as the person, the same rule T5 applied to surface dispatch. The GUI
//!   reads as the human through `get_layout_as` / `compiled_pane`, so the
//!   workspace a person opens is theirs. A read answered from the in-memory
//!   fallback store says so (`store: "fallback"`).
