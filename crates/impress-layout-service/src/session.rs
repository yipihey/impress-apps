//! The in-memory half of a layout: the tree, its two undo rings, and the
//! channel state that lives inside the tree already.
//!
//! A [`LayoutSession`] is one `(app_id, device)` scope. The store holds the
//! tree; the session holds the tree **plus the rings**, which are deliberately
//! not persisted: an undo ring is a record of what this sitting has done, and
//! restoring one from a file would let ⌘Z revert a gesture made on another
//! device last week (ADR-0031 D7 — undo never crosses a commit, and a quit is
//! at least as strong a boundary as a commit).
//!
//! Sessions live in a process-wide registry, the same shape
//! `impress_store_service::store_instance()` uses for the store: one map, one
//! mutex, entries created on first touch.
//!
//! # A cached session is checked against its row before every use
//!
//! Other writers hold sessions on the same row: `impress-mcp` and
//! `impress-cli` in their own processes, another chassis app on the same
//! file, another registry in this one. A session remembers the row revision
//! its tree came from ([`LayoutSession::revision`], the row's
//! `logical_clock`); [`SessionRegistry::with`] compares it with the row
//! before running anything — one indexed lookup — and when the row has moved
//! it **reloads**, dropping both undo rings, because their patches describe a
//! tree that is no longer the stored one. That is the honest outcome, and the
//! caller is told ([`LayoutSession::take_notice`]). Every save is
//! compare-and-swap on the same revision ([`LayoutSession::save`]), so the
//! window between the check and the write cannot lose a change either: a
//! save that finds the row moved writes nothing and marks the session stale
//! (review RL-L1). Before, a session loaded once was trusted forever, and
//! the next verb from a long-lived `impress-mcp` wrote its stale tree over
//! whatever the user had done since.
