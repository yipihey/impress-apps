//! The undo rings (ADR-0031 D7).
//!
//! There are three undo stacks and ⌘Z is routed by the focused leaf. The first
//! — the editor session's own undo manager — is not ours and is never touched.
//! The other two are here:
//!
//! 1. **arrangement**: split, move, close, swap, resize, retype, maximize,
//!    restore, role, window geometry — one ring for the whole layout, on its
//!    own chord;
//! 2. **exploration**: query, view kind, parameter bindings, channel and
//!    selection — **one ring per pane**, because exploring in one pane must
//!    not undo exploring in another.
//!
//! Focus verbs record nothing: undoing a focus move is what the opposite focus
//! move is for, and putting them on a ring means every ⌘Z spends a step on
//! where the cursor was.
//!
//! Undo never crosses a commit (D7); commits are `Durable` operations on the
//! store and are reverted item-wise, which is the service's business, not this
//! crate's.
