//! Hiding a pane: the weights that mean "toggled off".
//!
//! `PaneLayoutState`'s three Booleans (`sidebarVisible`, `listPaneVisible`,
//! `detailPaneVisible`) become shares in the tree, and the obvious encoding of
//! "hidden" — a share of `0.0` — **is not representable**:
//!
//! * [`crate::Verb::Resize`] refuses a share that is not a positive, finite
//!   weight ([`crate::LayoutError::InvalidShares`]), and
//! * [`crate::Layout::normalize`] repairs shares through `sane_share`, which
//!   rewrites any non-positive value to `1.0` — so a `0.0` written straight
//!   into the arena does not survive one normalization, and the pane that was
//!   meant to be hidden springs back to a full column.
//!
//! Both are checked in this module's tests rather than asserted about.
//! [`HIDDEN_SHARE`] is therefore the smallest representable alternative: a
//! hidden pane is one with almost no width, and it is **still in the tree** —
//! it keeps its query, its role and its session, so ⌘0 / ⌥⌘0 / ⌃⌘S are a
//! [`crate::Verb::Resize`] back rather than a close and a re-split. A toggle
//! must not cost the user the pane's state.
//!
//! This is one constant for the whole suite, and it lives here because
//! `impress-layout` is what both the service (which ships presets with a
//! hidden pane) and the FFI layer (whose `resize_share` is what the role
//! toggles call) already depend on. Two copies of a threshold are two answers
//! to "is this pane hidden?", and the renderer only gets to pick one.

/// The share a *hidden* pane carries.
///
/// `1e-4` rather than [`f32::MIN_POSITIVE`]: normalization joins a linear
/// container into its parent by `share * child / total`, and a denormal there
/// flushes to zero, which `sane_share` then turns back into a full column.
/// `1e-4` stays normal through several joins, and against any realistic sum
/// of sibling weights it is 0.1 px of a 3000 px window — zero to the eye,
/// positive to the arithmetic.
