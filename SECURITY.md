When reporting, please include:

1. Description of the vulnerability
2. Steps to reproduce
3. Potential impact
4. Any suggested fixes (optional)

## Response Timeline

- Acknowledge receipt within 48 hours

- Release a fix for confirmed vulnerabilities as soon as practical

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for:

| Version | Supported          |
