## Why imBib?

### BibTeX-Native
Your `.bib` files remain the source of truth. Import, edit, and export BibTeX without conversion artifacts. Full compatibility with BibDesk libraries.

### Unified Search
Search NASA ADS, arXiv, Crossref, Semantic Scholar, and more from a single interface. Results are deduplicated automatically—no more hunting for the same paper across services.

### Smart Searches
Save any search query as a Smart Search. Results update automatically and can feed new papers directly to your Inbox for triage.

### PDF Management
PDFs are stored with human-readable names (`Author_Year_Title.pdf`) and linked via BibTeX fields. Works with your existing BibDesk setup.

### Built for Academics
Designed by researchers, for researchers. No bloat, no subscription, no cloud lock-in. Your data stays on your Mac.
