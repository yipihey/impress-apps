# Contributing to imbib

Thanks for your interest in contributing to imbib! This document will help you get started.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- macOS 14.0 (Sonoma) or later
- Xcode 15.0 or later
- Swift 5.9+
- **XcodeGen** (for generating the Xcode project)

Install XcodeGen via Homebrew:
```bash
brew install xcodegen
```

### Building from Source

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yipihey/imbib.git
   cd imbib
   ```

2. Generate the Xcode project:
   ```bash
   cd imbib
   xcodegen generate
   ```

   > **Why this step?** The `.xcodeproj` is generated from `project.yml` and not stored in git. This keeps the repo clean and avoids merge conflicts in project files.

3. Open the Xcode project:
   ```bash
   open imbib.xcodeproj
   ```

4. Build and run in Xcode:
   - Select the **imbib** scheme (not imbib-iOS)
   - Select **My Mac** as the destination
   - Press **⌘R** to build and run

### Alternative: Build from Command Line

```bash
# Clone and enter the repository
git clone https://github.com/yipihey/imbib.git
cd imbib

# Build the Swift Package first (optional, Xcode does this automatically)
cd PublicationManagerCore
swift build
swift test  # Run tests
cd ..

# Generate the Xcode project and build
cd imbib
xcodegen generate
xcodebuild -scheme imbib -configuration Debug build

# The built app will be in:
# ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/imbib-*/Build/Products/Debug/imbib.app
```

### Troubleshooting

**"imbib.xcodeproj does not exist"**

The Xcode project is **generated**, not stored in git. You need to run XcodeGen first:

```bash
# Install XcodeGen if you haven't
brew install xcodegen

# From the repository root
cd imbib
xcodegen generate
open imbib.xcodeproj
```

The directory structure is:
```
imbib/                    ← Repository root (after git clone)
├── README.md
├── CONTRIBUTING.md
├── PublicationManagerCore/
└── imbib/                ← App directory
    ├── project.yml       ← XcodeGen spec (this IS in git)
    ├── imbib.xcodeproj   ← Generated by xcodegen (NOT in git)
    ├── imbib/            ← macOS app source
    └── imbib-iOS/        ← iOS app source
```

**"No such module 'PublicationManagerCore'"**

The Swift Package should resolve automatically. If not:
1. In Xcode, go to **File → Packages → Reset Package Caches**
2. Then **File → Packages → Resolve Package Versions**

**Build fails with signing errors**

1. In Xcode, select the **imbib** target
2. Go to **Signing & Capabilities**
3. Change **Team** to your Apple Developer account (or "None" for local builds)
4. You may need to change the **Bundle Identifier** if it conflicts

## Documentation

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) | System design and data flow |
| [CONVENTIONS.md](CONVENTIONS.md) | Coding style and patterns |
| [SOURCES.md](SOURCES.md) | How to implement search source plugins |
| [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) | AI-assisted development context |
| [docs/adr/](docs/adr/) | Architecture Decision Records |

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

We document significant technical decisions as ADRs. Browse them at [docs/adr/](docs/adr/).

Key decisions:
- **ADR-001**: Core Data over SwiftData
- **ADR-002**: BibTeX as source of truth
- **ADR-003**: Plugin architecture for search sources
- **ADR-004**: Human-readable PDF filenames

When making architectural changes, consider adding a new ADR.

## Development Workflow

1. **Create a branch** for your feature or fix
2. **Write tests** for new functionality
3. **Follow conventions** in [CONVENTIONS.md](CONVENTIONS.md)
4. **Run tests** before submitting: `swift test`
5. **Submit a PR** with a clear description

## Adding a New Search Source

See [SOURCES.md](SOURCES.md) for the complete guide. In brief:

1. Create a new file in `PublicationManagerCore/Sources/Sources/`
2. Implement the `SourcePlugin` protocol
3. Register in `SourceManager`
4. Add tests

## AI-Assisted Development

This project is designed to work well with AI coding assistants. See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for:

- Project context and architecture summary
- Key design decisions
- Current development phase
- Session continuity tips

## Reporting Issues

- Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/yipihey/imbib/issues)
- Include macOS/iOS version
- Include steps to reproduce
- Attach relevant logs from Console.app if applicable
