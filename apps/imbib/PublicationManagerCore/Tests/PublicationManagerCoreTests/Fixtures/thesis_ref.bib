We demonstrate the accuracy and precision of this new method using a large set of 1000 QUIJOTE simulations that each cover a comoving volume of 1h-1Gpc^3. The corrected resampling techniques recover the correct amplitude and structure of the data covariance matrix as represented by its principal components to within ∼10 per cent, the level of error achievable with the size of the sample of simulations used for the test. Our corrections for the internal resampling methods are shown to be robust against the intrinsic clustering of the cosmological tracers both in real-and redshift space using two snapshots at z = 0 and z = 1 that mimic two samples with significantly different clustering. We also analyse two different slicing of the simulation volume into n sv =64 or 125 sub-samples and show that the main impact of different, n sv, is on the structure of the covariance matrix due to the limited number of independent internal realizations that can be made given a fixed, n.},

   abstract = {We present a new power spectrum emulator named EuclidEmulator that estimates the nonlinear correction to the linear dark matter power spectrum depending on the six cosmological parameters ' ‰ b, ' ‰ m, n s, h, w 0, and σ 8. It is constructed using the uncertainty quantification software UQLab using a spectral decomposition method called polynomial chaos expansion. All steps in its construction have been tested and optimized: the large high-resolution N-body simulations carried out with PKDGRAV3 were validated using a simulation from the Euclid Flagship campaign and demonstrated to have converged up to wavenumbers kapprox 5, h, rm Mpc -1 for redshifts z ≤ 5. The emulator is based on 100 input cosmologies simulated in boxes of (1250 Mpc/h) 3 using 2048 3 particles. We show that by creating mock emulators it is possible to successfully predict and optimize the performance of the final emulator prior to performing any N-body simulations. The absolute accuracy of the final nonlinear power spectrum is as good as one obtained with N-body simulations, conservatively, sim 1 per cent for klesssim 1, h, rm Mpc -1 and z 2 1. This enables efficient forward modelling in the nonlinear regime, allowing for estimation of cosmological parameters using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. EuclidEmulator has been compared to HALOFIT, CosmicEmu, and NGenHalofit, and shown to be more accurate than these other approaches. This work paves a new way for optimal construction of future emulators that also consider other cosmological observables, use higher resolution input simulations, and investigate higher dimensional cosmological parameter spaces.},

   abstract = { We test a method to reduce unwanted sample variance when predicting Ly α forest power spectra from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. Sample variance arises due to sparse sampling of modes on large scales and propagates to small scales through nonlinear gravitational evolution. To tackle this, we generate initial conditions in which the density perturbation amplitudes are fixed to the ensemble average power spectrum—and are generated in pairs with exactly opposite phases. We run 50 such simulations (25 pairs) and compare their performance against 50 standard simulations by measuring the Ly α 1D and 3D power spectra at redshifts z  = 2, 3, and 4. Both ensembles use periodic boxes of      40    h   − 1   Mpc    containing 512 3 particles each of dark matter and gas. As a typical example of improvement, for wavenumbers      k = 0.25  h   Mpc   − 1      at z  = 3, we find estimates of the 1D and 3D power spectra converge 34 and 12 times faster in a paired–fixed ensemble compared with a standard ensemble. We conclude that, by reducing the computational time required to achieve fixed accuracy on predicted power spectra, the method frees up resources for exploration of varying thermal and cosmological parameters—ultimately allowing the improved precision and accuracy of statistical inference. },

We focus on characterizing statistics relevant to emission line and luminous red galaxies in the current and upcoming generation of galaxy surveys. We use a suite of precise particle mesh simulations (FASTPM) as well as with full N-body calculations with a mass resolution of ∼1.2 × 109 h -1M⊙ to investigate the recently suggested technique of Angulo and Pontzen to suppress the variance of cosmological simulations. We study redshift-space distortions, cosmic voids, higher order statistics from z = 2 down to 0. We find that both two- and three-point statistics are unbiased. Over the scales of interest for baryon acoustic oscillations and redshift-space distortions, we find that the variance is greatly reduced in the two-point statistics and in the cross-correlation between haloes and cosmic voids, but is not reduced significantly for the three-point statistics. We demonstrate that the accuracy of the two-point correlation function for a galaxy survey with effective volume of 20 (h-1Gpc)3 is improved by about a factor of 40, indicating that two pairs of simulations with a volume of 1 (h-1Gpc)3 lead to the equivalent variance of∼150 such simulations. The N-body simulations presented here thus provide an effective survey volume of about seven times the effective survey volume of Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument or Euclid.

We list a few tiny changes in CAMB which are necessary in order to reach such a level. Using the common limit of the two codes as a set of reference spectra, we derive precision settings corresponding to fixed levels of error in the computation of a CMB likelihood. We find that for a given precision level, CLASS is about 2.5 times faster than CAMB for computing the lensed CMB spectra of a LambdaCDM model.

The cosmology module implements Friedman–Lemaitre–Robertson–Walker cosmologies including curvature, relativistic species, and different dark energy equations of state, and provides fast computations of the linear matter power spectrum, variance, and correlation function. The LSS module is concerned with the properties of peaks in Gaussian random fields and halos in a statistical sense, including their peak height, peak curvature, halo bias, and mass function. The halo module deals with spherical overdensity radii and masses, density profiles, concentration, and the splashback radius. To facilitate the rapid exploration of these quantities, C olossus implements more than 40 different fitting functions from the literature.

The survey region covers 0.72 h^\{-3\} Gpc^3 over 3816 square degrees and 0.16<z<0.47, making it the best sample yet for the study of large-scale structure. We find a well-detected peak in the correlation function at 100h^\{-1\} Mpc separation that is an excellent match to the predicted shape and location of the imprint of the recombination-epoch acoustic oscillations on the low-redshift clustering of matter. This detection demonstrates the linear growth of structure by gravitational instability between z=1000 and the present and confirms a firm prediction of the standard cosmological theory. The acoustic peak provides a standard ruler by which we can measure the ratio of the distances to z=0.35 and z=1089 to 4% fractional accuracy and the absolute distance to z=0.35 to 5% accuracy. From the overall shape of the correlation function, we measure the matter density Omega_mh^2 to 8% and find agreement with the value from cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. Independent of the constraints provided by the CMB acoustic scale, we find Omega_m = 0.273 +- 0.025 + 0.123 (1+w_0) + 0.137 Omega_K. Including the CMB acoustic scale, we find that the spatial curvature is Omega_K=-0.010+-0.009 if the dark energy is a cosmological constant. More generally, our results provide a measurement of cosmological distance, and hence an argument for dark energy, based on a geometric method with the same simple physics as the microwave background anisotropies. The standard cosmological model convincingly passes these new and robust tests of its fundamental properties.},

   abstract = {The South Pole Telescope (SPT) is conducting a Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect survey over large areas of the southern sky, searching for massive galaxy clusters to high redshift. In this preliminary study, we focus on a 40 deg 2 area targeted by the Blanco Cosmology Survey (BCS), which is centered roughly at right ascension 5h30m, declination -53°(J2000). Over two seasons of observations, this entire region has been mapped by the SPT at 95GHz, 150GHz, and 225GHz. We report the four most significant SPT detections of SZ clusters in this field, three of which were previously unknown and, therefore, represent the first galaxy clusters discovered with an SZ survey. The SZ clusters are detected as decrements with greater than 5σ significance in the high-sensitivity 150GHz SPT map. The SZ spectrum of these sources is confirmed by detections of decrements at the corresponding locations in the 95GHz SPT map and nondetections at those locations in the 225GHz SPT map. Multiband optical images from the BCS survey demonstrate significant concentrations of similarly colored galaxies at the positions of the SZ detections. Photometric redshift estimates from the BCS data indicate that two of the clusters lie at moderate redshift (z∼ 0.4) and two at high redshift (z ≳ 0.8). One of the SZ detections was previously identified as a galaxy cluster in the optical as part of the Abell supplementary southern cluster catalog and in the X-ray using data from the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS). Potential RASS counterparts (not previously identified as clusters) are also found for two of the new discoveries. These first four galaxy clusters are the most significant SZ detections from a subset of the ongoing SPT survey. As such, they serve as a demonstration that SZ surveys, and the SPT in particular, can be an effective means for finding galaxy clusters. © 2009. The American Astronomical Society.

   abstract = {We present a method to recover the shape and amplitude of the power spectrum of mass fluctuations, P(k), from observations of the high redshift \lya forest. The method is motivated by the physical picture of the \lya forest that has emerged from hydrodynamic cosmological simulations and related semi-analytic models, which predicts a tight correlation between the \lya optical depth and the underlying matter density. We monotonically map the QSO spectrum to a Gaussian density field, measure its 3-d P(k), and normalize by evolving cosmological simulations with this P(k) until they reproduce the observed power spectrum of the QSO flux. Imposing the observed mean \lya opacity as a constraint makes the derived P(k) normalization insensitive to the choice of cosmological parameters, ionizing background spectrum, or reionization history. Thus, in contrast to estimates of P(k) from galaxy clustering, there are no uncertain "bias parameters" in the recovery of the mass power spectrum. We test the full procedure on SPH simulations of 3 cosmological models and show that it recovers their true mass power spectra on comoving scales ~1-10/h Mpc, the upper scale being set by the size of the simulation boxes. The procedure works even for noisy (S/N ~ 10), moderate resolution (~40 km/s pixels) spectra. We present an illustrative application to Q1422+231; the recovered P(k) is consistent with an \Omega=1, \sigma_8=0.5 CDM model. Application to large QSO samples should yield the power spectrum of mass fluctuations on small scales at z ~ 2-4. (Compressed)},

   abstract = {We discuss several ways that a distant radiation source (with a large redshift assumed due to the cosmological expansion) can provide information over a wide range of distances about the intervening medium. As we shall show [cf. Gunn and Peterson (1965)] neutral hydrogen (or other atoms) at various distances between the source and us will give rise to an ^absorption trough" in the continuous spectrum of a distant source. If the neutral hydrogen is instead concentrated in clusters of galaxies, this trough is replaced by a number of sharp absorption lines. Besides discussing (i) absorption troughs and (ii) absorption lines from clusters, we also consider (iii) photon scattering by free electrons in the intervening medium and (iv) spreading of a radio beam due to inho-mogeneities in the ionized gas that is traversed. Present observations furnish some stringent upper limits, and we suggest other feasible cosmological tests. Let z = (AX/X) be the "distance" or redshift measure, q 0 the deceleration parameter for the usual cosmological models (with cosmological constant equal to zero) that satisfy the field equations of general relativity (see, e.g., Bondi 1961, or Sandage 1961a, 6), H the Hubble parameter with « (10" H0 years)-1 (a subscript zero indicates a local value at the present epoch), and N the total density (in nucleons per cm 3). The evolving cosmolo-gies 1 require that the total number density satisfy a relation of the form : N\\{z\} = (1 + s)W 0 , (i) where Vo = 2 X 10-5 cm-3. The steady-state model requires N\\{z\} = Ao with A 0 « (1 or 2) X 10-5 cm-3 in some versions (Hoyle 1948; Hoyle and Narlikar 1962). We denote the redshift of a distant source by z s and that of an absorbing layer by z a-One can easily estimate (assuming a fairly flat ultraviolet spectrum [Greenstein and Schmidt 1964; Oke 1965; but see also Greenstein 1964]) values of z s that may be observed in QSS's in the near future. A QSS with the intrinsic brightness of 3C 273 (one of the brightest QSS's) would have an apparent magnitude of 20 for z s = 2.0 on the steady-state model (note that 3C 9 with z s = 2.05 is about seven times brighter than the above value), and for evolving cosmologies the z s corresponding to apparent magnitude 20 increases monotonically from z s = 2.5 for = 0 to 2 S = 5 for = 1. We shall see later than an ionized, evolving universe with > 1 is optically thick to Thomson scattering for z s > 5. i) Consider continuum radiation emitted from a distant source at frequencies v\\{\ + Zs\\}, where v is the received frequency, passing through the dilute gas which is postulated as a "substratum" in cosmology If a constituent of the gas has a resonance absorption line at a frequency then most of the absorption takes place at distances near z a , where Za (^res/ v) 1 = (^res/^emission) (1 "F ^s) 1 • (2^) 1 We assume that all physical constants are independent of z s (i.e., time). In particular, we assume that the relation between energy and wavelength for a photon emitted from a distant source is the same as for a photon emitted locally (constancy of he). Comparison of redshifts measured (e g, for 3C 273) with a diffraction grating (wavelength) and with a prism spectrometer (photon energy via the dispersion relation) or photoelectric detectors would check on the constancy of he. Large effects can already be excluded (¿[ln hc\/dt < 10-10 yr" 1) from the absence of any marked discrepancy for photons from distant sources in the two wavelengths for which atmospheric absorption sets in and photographic sensitivity falls off (both involve the photo effect and hence depend on photon energy). Similarly one can show from multiplet splittings in, e g., the spectra of 3C 47 and 3C 147 (Schmidt and Matthews 1964), that d In a 2 /dt < 10-11 yr-1 (where a is the fine-structure constant) and therefore the variation of a with z s cannot account for the redshifts of QSS's (cf, Savedoff 1956).},

Weak gravitational lensing is a technique that uses the distortions of the images of distant galaxies as a tracer of dark matter: such distortions are induced as the light passes through large-scale distributions of dark matter in the foreground. The patterns of the induced distortions reflect the density of mass along the line of sight and its distribution, and the resulting 'cosmic shear' can be used to distinguish between alternative cosmologies. But previous attempts to measure this effect have been inconclusive. Here we report the detection of cosmic shear on angular scales of up to half a degree using 145,000 galaxies and along three separate lines of sight. We find that the dark matter is distributed in a manner consistent with either an open universe, or a flat universe that is dominated by a cosmological constant.

   abstract = {<i>Aims. <i/>Redshift-space clustering anisotropies caused by cosmic peculiar velocities provide a powerful probe to test the gravity theory on large scales. However, to extract unbiased physical constraints, the clustering pattern has to be modelled accurately, taking into account the effects of non-linear dynamics at small scales, and properly describing the link between the selected cosmic tracers and the underlying dark matter field.<i>Methods. <i/>We used a large hydrodynamic simulation to investigate how the systematic error on the linear growth rate, <i>f<i/>, caused by model uncertainties, depends on sample selections and co-moving scales. Specifically, we measured the redshift-space two-point correlation function of mock samples of galaxies, galaxy clusters and active galactic nuclei, extracted from the Magneticum simulation, in the redshift range 0.2 ≤ <i>z<i/> ≤ 2, and adopting different sample selections.

Consequently the cluster number density as a function of cluster mass, or cluster abundance, is sensitive to cosmological parameters, particularly the matter density of the Universe $\Omega_\{\rm m\}$ and the amplitude of matter density fluctuation $\sigma_8$. In this review, we describe the methods used to detect galaxy clusters through optical near-infrared (O-NIR), X-ray, and CMB observations, outlining the advantages and disadvantages of cluster detection through different wavelengths. We describe methods for measuring cluster mass, with a particular focus on calibration by WL measurements. We then discuss how the connection between observables in different wavelengths and cluster abundance can be modeled through a cluster selection function and MOR, and quantify the impact of marginalization of nuisance parameters on cosmological constraints. Finally, we also walk through the recent results of cosmological constraints by cluster abundance with the O-NIR, X-ray, and CMB observations.},

To minimise the potential contamination by star-forming outliers, we selected our sample by combining different selection criteria, considering both photometric and spectroscopic information. The analysis of the observed spectral features provides direct evidence of an age evolution with redshift and of mass-downsizing, with more massive galaxies presenting stronger age-related features. To estimate the physical properties of the sample, we performed full spectral fitting with the code BAGPIPES, jointly analysing spectra and photometry of our sources without any cosmological assumption regarding the age of the population.<i>Results.<i/> The derived physical properties of the selected galaxies are characteristic of a passive population, with short star formation timescales (⟨<i>τ<i/>⟩ = 0.28 ± 0.02 Gyr), low dust extinction (⟨<i>A<i/><sub><i>V<i/>, dust<sub/>⟩ = 0.43 ± 0.02 mag), and sub-solar metallicities (⟨<i>Z<i/>/<i>Z<i/><sub>⊙<sub/>⟩ = 0.44 ± 0.01) compatible with other measurements of similar galaxies in this redshift range. The stellar ages, even if no cosmological constraint is assumed in the fit, show a decreasing trend compatible with a standard cosmological model, proving the robustness of the method in measuring the ageing of the population. Moreover, they show a distinctive mass-downsizing pattern, with more massive galaxies (⟨log(<i>M<i/><sub>⋆<sub/>/<i>M<i/><sub>⊙<sub/>)⟩ = 11.4) being older than less massive ones (⟨log(<i>M<i/><sub>⋆<sub/>/<i>M<i/><sub>⊙<sub/>)⟩ = 11.15) by ∼0.8 Gyr. We thoroughly tested the dependence of our results on the assumed SFH, finding a maximum 2% fluctuation on median results using models with significantly different functional forms. The derived ages are combined to build a median age–redshift relation, which we used to perform our cosmological analysis.<i>Conclusions.<i/> By fitting the median age–redshift relation with a flat ΛCDM model, assuming a Gaussian prior on Ω<sub>M, 0<sub/> = 0.3 ± 0.02 from late-Universe cosmological probes, we obtain a new estimate of the Hubble constant km s<sup>−1<sup/> Mpc<sup>−1<sup/>.

   abstract = {Weak lensing has become an increasingly important tool in cosmology and the use of galaxy shapes to measure cosmic shear has become routine. The weak-lensing distortion tensor contains two other effects in addition to the two components of shear: the convergence and rotation. The rotationmode is not measurable using the standard cosmic shear estimators based on galaxy shapes, as there is no information on the original shapes of the images before they were lensed. Due to this, no estimator has been proposed for the rotation mode in cosmological weak-lensing surveys, and the rotation mode has never been constrained. Here, we derive an estimator for this quantity, which is based on the use of radio polarization measurements of the intrinsic position angles of galaxies. The rotation mode can be sourced by physics beyond Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM), and also offers the chance to perform consistency checks of ΛCDM and of weak-lensing surveys themselves. We present simulations of this estimator and show that, for the pedagogical example of cosmic string spectra, this estimator could detect a signal that is consistent with the constraints from Planck. We examine the connection between the rotation mode and the shear B modes and thus how this estimator could help control systematics in future radio weak-lensing surveys.},

Our chosen cosmological tracer is a sample of blue galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), positioned at the effective redshift. Utilizing Planck-CMB input values for redshift-to-distance conversion, we derive the BAO scale Mpc h-1 at the 1 confidence level. Subsequently, we extrapolate the BAO signal scale in redshift space:. This measurement holds the potential to discriminate among dark energy models within the Local Universe.

Using N-body simulations and mock galaxy catalogues we confirm the accuracy of this expansion and compare it to the more commonly used Eulerian parametrization. For haloes hosting typical luminous red galaxies, the Lagrangian model provides a significantly better description of (δtracer | δm) at second order in perturbations. A second aspect of the matter-tracer connection is shot-noise, i.e. the scatter of tracer density around (δtracer | δm) . It is well known that this noise can be significantly non-Poissonian and we validate the performance of a more general, two-parameter shot-noise model for different tracers and simulations.

The corresponding solution for a collisionless gas is given, followed by a solution for a collisional gas with omega much less than one. Uncompensated holes are treated, giving solutions for a collisionless gas, a collisional gas, and for a mixture where the collisionless gas dominates.

   abstract = {We use a set of large cosmological N-body simulations to study the internal structure of dark matter haloes which form in scale-free hierarchical clustering models (initial power spectra P(k) ∝ kn with n = 0, -1 and -2) in an Ω = 1 universe. We find that the radius r178 in a halo corresponding to a mean interior overdensity of 178 accurately delineates the quasi-static halo interior from the surrounding infalling material, in agreement with the simple spherical collapse model. The interior velocity dispersion correlates with mass, again in good agreement with the spherical collapse model. Interior to the virial radius r178, the spherically averaged density, circular velocity and velocity dispersion profiles are well fitted by a simple two-parameter analytical model proposed by Navarro, Frenk & White. This model has p ∝ r-1 at small radii, steepening to ρ ∝ r-3 at large radii, and fits our haloes to the resolution limit of the simulations. The two model parameters, scalelength and mass, are tightly correlated. Lower mass haloes are more centrally concentrated, and so have scalelengths which are a smaller fraction of their virial radius than those of their higher mass counterparts. This reflects the earlier formation times of low-mass haloes. The haloes are moderately aspherical, with typical axial ratios 1 : 0.8 : 0.65 at their virial radii, becoming gradually more spherical towards their centres. The haloes are generically triaxial, but with a slight preference for prolate over oblate configurations, at least for n = -1 and 0. These shapes are maintained by an anisotropic velocity dispersion tensor. The median value of the spin parameter is λ ≈ 0.04, with a weak trend for lower λ. at higher halo mass. We also investigate how the halo properties depend on the algorithm used to identify them in the simulations, using both friends-of-friends and spherical overdensity methods. We find that, for groups selected at mean overdensities ∼ 100-400 by either method, the properties are insensitive to how the haloes are selected, if the halo centre is taken as the position of the most bound particle.},

In this approach, all mass is associated with virialized dark matter halos; models of the number and spatial distribution of the halos, and the distribution of dark matter within each halo, are used to provide estimates of how the statistical properties of large scale density and velocity fields evolve as a result of non-linear gravitational clustering. We first describe the model, and demonstrate its accuracy by comparing its predictions with exact results from numerical simulations of non-linear gravitational clustering. We then present several astrophysical applications of the halo model: these include models of the spatial distribution of galaxies, the non-linear velocity, momentum and pressure fields, descriptions of weak gravitational lensing, and estimates of secondary contributions to temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

   abstract = {We apply standard disk formation theory with adiabatic contraction within cuspy halo models predicted by the standard LCDM cosmology. The resulting models score remarkably well when confronted with the broad range of observational data available for the Milky Way and M31 galaxies, giving a Milky Way virial mass of 1-2x10^12Msun and concentration C=12-17. We consider two types of models, in which: (A) baryons conserve angular momentum and (B) some of the angular momentum of the baryons is transferred to the dark matter. Type-A models produce good agreement with observed rotation curves and obey constraints in the solar neighborhood, but may have too much dark matter in the center to allow a fast rotating bar. The type-B models with angular momentum transport have a slightly more massive disk and less dark matter in the central part, allowing a fast rotating bar to persist. Both classes of models probably have sufficient baryonic mass in the central 3.5kpc to reproduce recent observational values of the optical depth to microlensing events towards the Galactic center. All models require that about 1/2 of all baryons expected inside the virial radius must not be in the disk or bulge. We investigate whether the range of virial masses allowed by our dynamical models is compatible with constraints from the galaxy luminosity function, and find a range of parameter space that is allowed by this constraint. We conclude that rotation curves and dynamical properties of ``normal'' high surface brightness spiral galaxies appear to be consistent with standard LCDM.},

   abstract = {For 21 Sc galaxies whose properties encompass a wide range of radii, masses, and luminosities, we have obtained major axis spectra extending to the faint outer regions, and have deduced rotation curves. The galaxies are of high inclination, so uncertainties in the angle of inclination to the line of sight and in the position angle of the major axis are minimized. Their radii range from 4 to 122 kpc (H = 50km s-1 Mpc-1); in general, the rotation curves extend to 83% or R25i.b. When plotted on a linear scale with no scaling, the rotation curves for the smallest galaxies fall upon the initial parts of the rotation curves for the larger galaxies. All curves show a fairly rapid velocity rise to V ∼ 125 km s-1 at R ∼ 5 kpc, and a slower rise thereafter. Most rotation curves are rising slowly even at the farthest measured point. Neither high nor low luminosity Sc galaxies have falling rotation curves. Sc galaxies of all luminosities must have significant mass located beyond the optical image. A linear relation between log Vmax and log R follows from the shape of the common rotation curve for all Sc's, and the tendency of smaller galaxies, at any R, to have lower velocities than the large galaxies at that R. The significantly shallower slope discovered for this relation by Tully and Fisher is attributed to their use of galaxies of various Hubble types and the known correlation of Vmax with Hubble type. The galaxies with very large central velocity gradients tend to be large, of high luminosity, with massive, dense nuclei. Often their nuclear spectra show a strong stellar continuum in the red, with emission lines of [N II] stronger than Hα. These galaxies also tend to be 13 cm radio continuum sources. Because of the form of the rotation curves, small galaxies undergo many short-period, very differential, rotations. Large galaxies undergo (in their outer parts) few, only slightly differential, rotations. This suggests a relation between morphology, rotational properties, and the van den Bergh luminosity classification, which is discussed. UGC 2885, the largest Sc in the sample, has undergone fewer than 10 rotations in its outer parts since the origin of the universe but has a regular two-armed spiral pattern and no significant velocity asymmetries. This observation puts constraints on models of galaxy formation and evolution.},

In the past, the leading particle candidates were cold and collisionless, and typically predicted missing energy signals at particle colliders. However, recent progress has greatly expanded the list of well-motivated candidates and the possible signatures of dark matter. This review begins with a brief summary of the standardmodel of particle physics and its outstanding problems. I then discuss several dark matter candidates motivated by these problems, including weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), superWIMPs, light gravitinos, hidden dark matter, sterile neutrinos, and axions. For each of these, I critically examine the particle physics motivations and present their expected production mechanisms, basic properties, and implications for direct and indirect detection, particle colliders, and astrophysical observations. Upcoming experiments will discover or exclude many of these candidates, and progress may open up an era of unprecedented synergy between studies of the largest and smallest observable length scales. © 2010 by Annual Reviews.},

Amongst his many legacies is the Zel'dovich approximation for the growth of large-scale structure, which remains one of the most successful and insightful analytic models of structure formation. We use the Zel'dovich approximation to compute the two-point function of the matter and biased tracers, and compare to the results of N-body simulations and other Lagrangian perturbation theories.We show that Lagrangian perturbation theories converge well and that the Zel'dovich approximation provides a good fit to the N-body results except for the quadrupole moment of the halo correlation function. We extend the calculation of halo bias to third order and also consider non-local biasing schemes, none of which remove the discrepancy. We argue that a part of the discrepancy owes to an incorrect prediction of inter-halo velocity correlations. We use the Zel'dovich approximation to compute the ingredients of the Gaussian streaming model and show that this hybrid method provides a good fit to clustering of haloes in redshift space down to scales of tens of Mpc. © 2014 The Author Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

   abstract = {We describe and test a new method for creating initial conditions for cosmological N-body dark matter simulations based on second-order Lagrangian perturbation theory (2lpt). The method can be applied to multimass particle distributions making it suitable for creating resimulation, or 'zoom' initial conditions. By testing against an analytic solution, we show that the method works well for a spherically symmetric perturbation with radial features ranging over more than three orders of magnitude in linear scale and 11 orders of magnitude in particle mass. We apply the method and repeat resimulations of the rapid formation of a high-mass halo at redshift ∼50 and the formation of a Milky Way mass dark matter halo at redshift zero. In both cases, we find that many properties of the final halo show a much smaller sensitivity to the start redshift with the 2lpt initial conditions than simulations started from Zel'dovich initial conditions. For spherical overdense regions, structure formation is erroneously delayed in simulations starting from Zel'dovich initial conditions, and we demonstrate for the case of the formation of the high-redshift halo that this delay can be accounted for using the spherical collapse model. In addition to being more accurate, 2lpt initial conditions allow simulations to start later, saving computer time. © 2010 The Author. Journal compilation © 2010 RAS.},

   abstract = {The accelerating expansion of the universe is the most surprising cosmological discovery in many decades, implying that the universe is dominated by some form of "dark energy" with exotic physical properties, or that Einstein's theory of gravity breaks down on cosmological scales. The profound implications of cosmic acceleration have inspired ambitious efforts to understand its origin, with experiments that aim to measure the history of expansion and growth of structure with percent-level precision or higher. We review in detail the four most well established methods for making such measurements: Type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), weak gravitational lensing, and the abundance of galaxy clusters. We pay particular attention to the systematic uncertainties in these techniques and to strategies for controlling them at the level needed to exploit "Stage IV" dark energy facilities such as BigBOSS, LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST. We briefly review a number of other approaches including redshift-space distortions, the Alcock-Paczynski effect, and direct measurements of the Hubble constant H0. We present extensive forecasts for constraints on the dark energy equation of state and parameterized deviations from General Relativity, achievable with Stage III and Stage IV experimental programs that incorporate supernovae, BAO, weak lensing, and cosmic microwave background data. We also show the level of precision required for clusters or other methods to provide constraints competitive with those of these fiducial programs. We emphasize the value of a balanced program that employs several of the most powerful methods in combination, both to cross-check systematic uncertainties and to take advantage of complementary information. Surveys to probe cosmic acceleration produce data sets that support a wide range of scientific investigations, and they continue the longstanding astronomical tradition of mapping the universe in ever greater detail over ever larger scales. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {The amplification of density perturbations existing at the epoch of decoupling and which become bound within the linear regime of gravitational-instability theory and subsequently collapse into protogalaxies is calculated in the context of zero-pressure Friedmann-Lemaitre universes. The various cosmological models obtained as solutions to the Friedmann differential equation are classified in terms of the deceleration and density parameters. Analytical solutions to the density-perturbation equation for zero, positive, and negative cosmological constants are presented in terms of redshift, density parameter, and deceleration parameter. Conditions are derived for bound perturbations, which will eventually collapse into discrete systems, and the amplification of density perturbations existing at the epoch of decoupling is evaluated numerically for two different values each of the density parameter and the decoupling redshift. The results show that amplification increases with decreasing values of the deceleration parameter.},

   abstract = { We present Milky Way-est, a suite of 20 cosmological cold-dark-matter-only zoom-in simulations of Milky Way (MW)-like host halos. Milky Way-est hosts are selected such that they (i) are consistent with the MW’s measured halo mass and concentration, (ii) accrete a Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)-like (≈10 11 M ⊙ ) subhalo within the last 2 Gyr on a realistic orbit, placing them near 50 kpc from the host center at z ≈ 0, and (iii) undergo a >1:5 sub-to-host halo mass ratio merger with a Gaia–Sausage–Enceladus (GSE)-like system at early times (0.67 < z < 3). Hosts satisfying these LMC and GSE constraints constitute <1% of all halos in the MW’s mass range, and their total masses grow rapidly at late times due to LMC analog accretion. Compared to hosts of a similar final halo mass that are not selected to include LMC and GSE analogs, Milky Way-est hosts contain 22% more subhalos with present-day virial masses above 10 8 M ⊙ throughout the virial radius, on average. This enhancement reaches ≈80% in the inner 100 kpc and is largely, if not entirely, due to LMC-associated subhalos. These systems also induce spatial anisotropy in Milky Way-est subhalo populations, with ≈60% of the total subhalo population within 100 kpc found in the current direction of the LMC. Meanwhile, we find that GSE-associated subhalos do not significantly contribute to present-day Milky Way-est subhalo populations. These results provide context for our Galaxy’s dark matter structure and subhalo population and will help interpret a range of measurements that are currently only possible in the MW. },

In this paper, we determine a general expression for $\gamma$ that applies to any models with a mixture of cold dark matter plus cosmological constant or quintessence (a time-evolving, spatially-inhomogeneous component with negative pressure) including dependence on the spectral index $n$, the Hubble constant $h$, and the equation-of-state of the quintessence component $w$. The cluster constraint is combined with COBE measurements to identify a spectrum of best-fitting models. The constraint from the evolution of rich clusters is also discussed.},

We investigate here the accuracy of the tight-coupling approximation commonly used to numerically evolve the baryon and photon perturbation equations at early times. By solving the exact perturbations equations with a stiff solver starting deep in the radiation-dominated epoch, we find the level of inaccuracy introduced by resorting to the standard first-order tight-coupling approximation. We develop a new second-order approximation in the inverse Thomson opacity expansion and show that it closely tracks the full solution, at essentially no extra numerical cost. We find the bias on estimates of cosmological parameters introduced by the first-order approximation is, for most parameters, negligible. Finally, we show that our second-order approximation can be used to reduce the time needed to compute cosmic microwave background angular spectra by as much as ∼17%. © 2011 American Physical Society.},

We argue that the technique is valuable for improving our understanding of cosmic structure formation. The A and B fields are by definition equally likely draws from ΛCDM initial conditions, and in the linear regime evolve identically up to the overall sign. As nonlinear evolution takes hold, a region that collapses to form a halo in simulation A will tend to expand to create a void in simulation B. Applications include (i) contrasting the growth of A-halos and B-voids to test excursion-set theories of structure formation, (ii) cross-correlating the density field of the A and B universes as a novel test for perturbation theory, and (iii) canceling error terms by averaging power spectra between the two boxes.

   abstract = { A major question in ΛCDM is what this theory actually predicts for the properties of subhalo populations. Subhalos are difficult to accurately simulate and to find within simulations, and this propagates into uncertainty in theoretical predictions for satellite galaxies. We present Symfind , a new particle-tracking-based subhalo finder, and demonstrate that it can track subhalos to orders-of-magnitude lower masses than commonly used halo-finding tools, with a focus on Rockstar and consistent-trees . These longer survival times mean that at a fixed peak subhalo mass, we find ≈ 15%–40% more subhalos within the virial radius, R vir , and ≈35%–120% more subhalos within R vir /4 in the Symphony dark-matter-only simulation suite. More subhalos are found as the resolution is increased, in contrast to the Rockstar halo finder, which appears to be converged at smaller subhalo counts. We perform extensive numerical testing. In agreement with idealized simulations, we show that the       v max    , the maximum circular velocity, is systematically biased low until high resolutions ( n peak ≳ 3 × 10 4 ) are achieved, but that mass loss itself can be resolved at much more modest resolutions ( n peak ≳ 4 × 10 3 ). We show that Rockstar converges to false solutions for the mass function, radial distribution, and disruption masses of subhalos. We argue that our new method can trace resolved subhalos until the point of typical galaxy disruption without invoking post hoc orphan modeling. We outline a concrete set of steps for determining whether other subhalo finders meet the same criteria. We publicly release Symfind catalogs and particle data for the Symphony simulation suite at http://web.stanford.edu/group/gfc/symphony . },

   abstract = { We present cosmological results from the measurement of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in galaxy, quasar and Lyman- α forest tracers from the first year of observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), to be released in the DESI Data Release 1. DESI BAO provide robust measurements of the transverse comoving distance and Hubble rate, or their combination, relative to the sound horizon, in seven redshift bins from over 6 million extragalactic objects in the redshift range 0.1 < z < 4.2. To mitigate confirmation bias, a blind analysis was implemented to measure the BAO scales. DESI BAO data alone are consistent with the standard flat ΛCDM cosmological model with a matter density Ω m =0.295±0.015. Paired with a baryon density prior from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the robustly measured acoustic angular scale from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), DESI requires H 0 =(68.52±0.62) km s -1 Mpc -1 . In conjunction with CMB anisotropies from Planck and CMB lensing data from Planck and ACT, we find Ω m =0.307± 0.005 and H 0 =(67.97±0.38) km s -1 Mpc -1 . Extending the baseline model with a constant dark energy equation of state parameter w , DESI BAO alone require w =-0.99 +0.15 -0.13 . In models with a time-varying dark energy equation of state parametrised by w 0 and  w a  , combinations of DESI with CMB or with type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) individually prefer w 0 > -1 and  w a  < 0. This preference is 2.6 σ for the DESI+CMB combination, and persists or grows when SN Ia are added in, giving results discrepant with the ΛCDM model at the 2.5 σ , 3.5 σ or 3.9 σ levels for the addition of the Pantheon+, Union3, or DES-SN5YR supernova datasets respectively. For the flat ΛCDM model with the sum of neutrino mass ∑  m ν  free, combining the DESI and CMB data yields an upper limit ∑  m ν  < 0.072 (0.113) eV at 95% confidence for a ∑  m ν  > 0 (∑  m ν  > 0.059) eV prior. These neutrino-mass constraints are substantially relaxed if the background dynamics are allowed to deviate from flat ΛCDM. },

An initially adiabatic constant curvature perturbation spectrum is assumed. In models with cold dark matter, the simplest hypothesis - that galaxies follow the mass distribution leads to small-scale anisotropies which exceed current observational limits if omega is less than 0.2 h to the -4/3. Since low values of omega are indicated by dynamical studies of galaxy clustering, cold particle models in which light traces mass are probably incorrect. Reheating of the pregalactic medium is unlikely to modify this conclusion. In cold particle or neutrino-dominated universes with omega = 1, presented predictions for small-scale and quadrupole anisotropies are below current limits. In all cases, the small-scale fluctuations are predicted to be about 10 percent linearly polarized.},

The survival of primordial fluctuations to an epoch when galaxy formation may occur is found to imply an angular anisotropy in the 30 K radiation of between approximately tO" and 30", depending on the mean value taken for the present density of matter in the Universe. An upper limit is also derived on the mass of a gravitationally bound condensation by considering the destabilizing tendency of the radiation A consequence of this result is that any large-scale (Â»= 100 Mpc) anisotropy in the Universe would be consistent with a value for the mean density of matter at the present epoch of only about 10-30 g/cm3 or less.},

   abstract = {Perturbations of the matter density in a homogeneous and isotropic cosmological model which leads to the formation of galaxies should, at later stages of evolution, cause spatial fluctuations of relic radiation. Silk assumed that an adiabatic connection existed between the density perturbations at the moment of recombination of the initial plasma and fluctuations of the observed temperature of radiation δT/T=δρ\{variant\}m/3ρ\{variant\}m. It is shown in this article that such a simple connection is not applicable due to: (1) The long time of recombination; (2) The fact that when regions with M<1015M⊙ become transparent for radiation, the optical depth to the observer is still large due to Thompson scattering; (3) The spasmodic increase of δρ\{variant\}m/ρ\{variant\}m in recombination. As a result the expected temperature fluctuations of relic radiation should be smaller than adiabatic fluctuations. In this article the value of δT/T arising from scattering of radiation on moving electrons is calculated; the velocity field is generated by adiabatic or entropy density perturbations. Fluctuations of the relic radiation due to secondary heating of the intergalactic gas are also estimated. A detailed investigation of the spectrum of fluctuations may, in principle, lead to an understanding of the nature of initial density perturbations since a distinct periodic dependence of the spectral density of perturbations on wavelength (mass) is peculiar to adiabatic perturbations. Practical observations are quite difficult due to the smallness of the effects and the presence of fluctuations connected with discrete sources of radio emission. © 1970 D.

The existence of an event horizon during the de Sitter phase gives rise to zero-point fluctuations in the scalar field, whose slowly growing expectation value signals the transition to the spontaneous-symmetry- breaking (SSB) phase of a grand unified theory (GUT). The fluctuations in are created on small distance scales and expanded to large scales, eventually giving rise to an almost scale-free spectrum of adiabatic density perturbations (the so-called Zel'dovich spectrum). When a fluctuation reenters the horizon (radius H-1) during the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) phase that follows the exponential expansion, it has a perturbation amplitude |H=(4or25)H(t1), where H is the Hubble constant during the de Sitter phase (H-1 is the radius of the event horizon), (t1) is the mean value of at the time (t1) that the wavelength of the perturbation expanded beyond the Hubble radius during the de Sitter epoch, is the fluctuation in at time t1 on the same scale, and 4 (25) applies if the Universe is radiation (matter) dominated when the scale in question reenters the horizon. Scales larger than about 1015-1016M reenter the horizon when the Universe is matter dominated. Owing to the Sachs-Wolfe effect, these density perturbations give rise to temperature fluctuations in the microwave background which, on all angular scales 1°, are TT (15)H (t1). The value of expected from de Sitter fluctuations is O(H2). For the simplest model of "new inflation," that based on an SU(5) GUT with Coleman-Weinberg SSB, (t1) H2 so that TT1 in obvious conflict with the large-scale isotropy of the microwave background. One remedy for this is a model in which the inflation occurs when (t1) H2. We analyze a supersymmetric model which has this feature, and show that a value of |H10-4-10-3 on all observable scales is not implausible. © 1983 The American Physical Society.},

   abstract = {The "threshold epoch" of classical cosmology is first discussed from a classical point of view. It is shown that if the density fluctuations at this epoch are proportional to N−n (where N is the number of particles in a disturbance), then n must exactly, or very closely, equal the value 23 in order that such fluctuations develop into protogalaxies. This result is independent of the value of the threshold epoch, and of the equation of state for the very early universe. Arguments of a speculative nature are then presented which indicate that the threshold epoch occurs at the Planck density. It is also proposed that the initial conditions of galaxy formation are metric fluctuations at the threshold epoch of classical cosmology. The evidence in favor of this theory is (i) the density fluctuation obeys the n=23 rule, and (ii) the spin fluctuation gives an eventual angular momentum of the order N43ℏ, in reasonable agrement with that of the Galaxy.},

   abstract = {Analysis of the <i>Planck<i/> 2018 data set indicates that the statistical properties of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature anisotropies are in excellent agreement with previous studies using the 2013 and 2015 data releases. In particular, they are consistent with the Gaussian predictions of the ΛCDM cosmological model, yet also confirm the presence of several so-called “anomalies” on large angular scales. The novelty of the current study, however, lies in being a first attempt at a comprehensive analysis of the statistics of the polarization signal over all angular scales, using either maps of the Stokes parameters, <i>Q<i/> and <i>U<i/>, or the <i>E<i/>-mode signal derived from these using a new methodology (which we describe in an appendix). Although remarkable progress has been made in reducing the systematic effects that contaminated the 2015 polarization maps on large angular scales, it is still the case that residual systematics (and our ability to simulate them) can limit some tests of non-Gaussianity and isotropy. However, a detailed set of null tests applied to the maps indicates that these issues do not dominate the analysis on intermediate and large angular scales (i.e., <i>ℓ<i/> ≲ 400). In this regime, no unambiguous detections of cosmological non-Gaussianity, or of anomalies corresponding to those seen in temperature, are claimed. Notably, the stacking of CMB polarization signals centred on the positions of temperature hot and cold spots exhibits excellent agreement with the ΛCDM cosmological model, and also gives a clear indication of how <i>Planck<i/> provides state-of-the-art measurements of CMB temperature and polarization on degree scales.},

   abstract = {We test the statistical isotropy and Gaussianity of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies using observations made by the Planck satellite. Our results are based mainly on the full Planck mission for temperature, but also include some polarization measurements. In particular, we consider the CMB anisotropy maps derived from the multi-frequency Planck data by several component-separation methods. For the temperature anisotropies, we find excellent agreement between results based on these sky maps over both a very large fraction of the sky and a broad range of angular scales, establishing that potential foreground residuals do not affect our studies. Tests of skewness, kurtosis, multi-normality, N-point functions, and Minkowski functionals indicate consistency with Gaussianity, while a power deficit at large angular scales is manifested in several ways, for example low map variance. The results of a peak statistics analysis are consistent with the expectations of a Gaussian random field. The "Cold Spot" is detected with several methods, including map kurtosis, peak statistics, and mean temperature profile. We thoroughly probe the large-scale dipolar power asymmetry, detecting it with several independent tests, and address the subject of a posteriori correction. Tests of directionality suggest the presence of angular clustering from large to small scales, but at a significance that is dependent on the details of the approach. We perform the first examination of polarization data, finding the morphology of stacked peaks to be consistent with the expectations of statistically isotropic simulations. Where they overlap, these results are consistent with the Planck 2013 analysis based on the nominal mission data and provide our most thorough view of the statistics of the CMB fluctuations to date.},

   abstract = {The two fundamental assumptions of the standard cosmological model – that the initial fluctuations are statistically isotropic and Gaussian – are rigorously tested using maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy from the <i>Planck<i/> satellite. The detailed results are based on studies of four independent estimates of the CMB that are compared to simulations using a fiducial ΛCDM model and incorporating essential aspects of the <i>Planck<i/> measurement process. Deviations from isotropy have been found and demonstrated to be robust against component separation algorithm, mask choice, and frequency dependence. Many of these anomalies were previously observed in the WMAP data, and are now confirmed at similar levels of significance (about 3<i>σ<i/>). However, we find little evidence of non-Gaussianity, with the exception of a few statistical signatures that seem to be associated with specific anomalies. In particular, we find that the quadrupole-octopole alignment is also connected to a low observed variance in the CMB signal. A power asymmetry is now found to persist on scales corresponding to about <i>ℓ<i/> = 600 and can be described in the low-<i>ℓ<i/> regime by a phenomenological dipole modulation model. However, any primordial power asymmetry is strongly scale-dependent and does not extend toarbitrarily small angular scales. Finally, it is plausible that some of these features may be reflected in the angular power spectrum of the data, which shows a deficit of power on similar scales. Indeed, when the power spectra of two hemispheres defined by a preferred direction are considered separately, one shows evidence of a deficit in power, while its opposite contains oscillations between odd and even modes that may be related to the parity violation and phase correlations also detected in the data. Although these analyses represent a step forward in building an understanding of the anomalies, a satisfactory explanation based on physically motivated models is still lacking.},

   abstract = {This paper presents the first cosmological results based on Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and lensing-potential power spectra. We find that the Planck spectra at high multipoles (40) are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flat six-parameter λCDM cosmology with a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations. Within the context of this cosmology, the Planck data determine the cosmological parameters to high precision: the angular size of the sound horizon at recombination, the physical densities of baryons and cold dark matter, and the scalar spectral index are estimated to be θ- = (1.04147 ± 0.00062) × 10-2, Ωbh2 = 0.02205 ± 0.00028, Ωch2 = 0.1199 ± 0.0027, and ns = 0.9603 ± 0.0073, respectively(note that in this abstract we quote 68% errors on measured parameters and 95% upper limits on other parameters). For this cosmology, we find a low value of the Hubble constant, H0 = (67.3 ± 1.2) km s-1 Mpc-1, and a high value of the matter density parameter, Ωm = 0.315 ± 0.017. These values are in tension with recent direct measurements of H0 and the magnitude-redshift relation for Type Ia supernovae, but are in excellent agreement with geometrical constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) surveys. Including curvature, we find that the Universe is consistent with spatial flatness to percent level precision using Planck CMB data alone. We use high-resolution CMB data together with Planck to provide greater control on extragalactic foreground components in an investigation of extensions to the six-parameter λCDM model. We present selected results from a large grid of cosmological models, using a range of additional astrophysical data sets in addition to Planck and high-resolution CMB data. None of these models are favoured over the standard six-parameter λCDM cosmology. The deviation of the scalar spectral index from unity isinsensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changes in the matter content of the Universe. We find an upper limit of r0.002 < 0.11 on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. There is no evidence for additional neutrino-like relativistic particles beyond the three families of neutrinos in the standard model. Using BAO and CMB data, we find Neff = 3.30 ± 0.27 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of 0.23 eV for the sum of neutrino masses. Our results are in excellent agreement with big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of Neff = 3.046. We find no evidence for dynamical dark energy; using BAO and CMB data, the dark energy equation of state parameter is constrained to be w =-1.13-0.10+0.13. We also use the Planck data to set limits on a possible variation of the fine-structure constant, dark matter annihilation and primordial magnetic fields. Despite the success of the six-parameter λCDM model in describing the Planck data at high multipoles, we note that this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the temperature power spectrum at low multipoles. The unusual shape of the spectrum in the multipole range 20 40 was seen previously in the WMAP data and is a real feature of the primordial CMB anisotropies. The poor fit to the spectrum at low multipoles is not of decisive significance, but is an "anomaly" in an otherwise self-consistent analysis of the Planck temperature data.},

   abstract = {We present full sky microwave maps in five bands (23 to 94 GHz) from the WMAP first year sky survey. Calibration errors are <0.5% and the low systematic error level is well specified. The 2<l<900 anisotropy power spectrum is cosmic variance limited for l<354 with a signal-to-noise ratio >1 per mode to l=658. The temperature-polarization cross-power spectrum reveals both acoustic features and a large angle correlation from reionization. The optical depth of reionization is 0.17 +/- 0.04, which implies a reionization epoch of 180+220-80 Myr (95% CL) after the Big Bang at a redshift of 20+10-9 (95% CL) for a range of ionization scenarios. This early reionization is incompatible with the presence of a significant warm dark matter density. The age of the best-fit universe is 13.7 +/- 0.2 Gyr old. Decoupling was 379+8-7 kyr after the Big Bang at a redshift of 1089 +/- 1. The thickness of the decoupling surface was dz=195 +/- 2. The matter density is Omega_m h^2 = 0.135 +0.008 -0.009, the baryon density is Omega_b h^2 = 0.0224 +/- 0.0009, and the total mass-energy of the universe is Omega_tot = 1.02 +/- 0.02. The spectral index of scalar fluctuations is fit as n_s = 0.93 +/- 0.03 at wavenumber k_0 = 0.05 Mpc^-1, with a running index slope of dn_s/d ln k = -0.031 +0.016 -0.018 in the best-fit model. This flat universe model is composed of 4.4% baryons, 22% dark matter and 73% dark energy. The dark energy equation of state is limited to w<-0.78 (95% CL). Inflation theory is supported with n_s~1, Omega_tot~1, Gaussian random phases of the CMB anisotropy, and superhorizon fluctuations. An admixture of isocurvature modes does not improve the fit. The tensor-to-scalar ratio is r(k_0=0.002 Mpc^-1)<0.90 (95% CL).},

   abstract = {The first year of data from the Differential Microwave Radiometers (DMR) on the Cosmic Backgoround Explorer (COBE) show statistically significant (>7 σ) structure that is well described as scale-invariant fluctuations with a Gaussian distribution. The major portion of the observed structure cannot be attributed to known systematic errors in the instrument, artifacts generated in the data processing, or known Galactic emission. The structure is consistent with a thermal spectrum at 31, 53, and 90 GHz as expected for cosmic microwave background anisotropy. The rms sky variation, smoothed to a total 10° FWHM Gaussian, is 30 ± 5 μK (ΔT/T = 11 × 10-6) for Galactic latitude |b| > 20° data with the dipole anisotropy removed. The rms cosmic quadrupole amplitude is 13 ± 4 μK (ΔT/T ≈ 5 × 10-6). The angular autocorrelation of the signal in each radiometer channel and cross-correlation between channels are consistent and give a primordial fluctuation power-law spectrum with index n = 1.1 ± 0.5, and an rms-quadrupole-normalized amplitude of 16 ± 4 μK(ΔT/T ≈ 6 × 10-6). These features are in accord with the Harrison-Zel'dovich (scale-invariant, n = 1) spectrum predicted by models of inflationary cosmology. The low overall fluctuation amplitude is consistent with theoretical predictions of the minimal level gravitational potential variations that would give rise to the observed present day structure.},

The Board of Editors does not hold itself responsible for the opinions expressed by the correspondents. Communications should not exceed 600 words in length. A S pointed out by one of us, ' various nuclear species must have originated not as the result of an equilibrium corresponding to a certain temperature and density, but rather as a consequence of a continuous building-up process arrested by a rapid expansion and cooling of the primordial matter. According to this picture, we must imagine the early stage of matter as a highly compressed neutron gas (overheated neutral nuclear Quid) which started decaying into protons and electrons when the gas pressure fell down as the result of universal expansion. The radiative capture of the still remaining neutrons by the newly formed protons must have led first to the formation of deuterium nuclei, and the subsequent neutron captures resulted in the building up of heavier and heavier nuclei. It must be remembered that, due to the comparatively short time allowed for this procgss, ' the building up of heavier nuclei must have proceeded just above the upper fringe of the stable elements (short-lived Fermi elements), and the present frequency distribution of various atomic species was attained only somewhat later as the result of adjustment of their electric charges by P-decay. Thus the observed slope of the abundance curve must not be related to the temperature of the original neutron gas, but rather to the time period permitted by the expansion process. Also, the individual abundances of various nuclear species must depend not so much on their intrinsic stabilities (mass defects) as on the values of their neutron capture cross sections. The equations governing such a building-up process apparently can be written in the form: We may remark at first that the building-up process was apparently completed when the temperature of the neutron gas was still rather high, since otherwise the observed abundances would have been strongly affected by the resonances in the region of the slow neutrons. According to Hughes, 2 the neutron capture cross sections of various elements (for neutron energies of about 1 Mev) increase exponentially with atomic number halfway up the periodic system, remaining approximately constant for heavier elements. Using these cross sections, one finds by integrating Eqs. (1) as shown in Fig. 1 that the relative abundances of various nuclear species decrease rapidly for the lighter elements and remain approximately constant for the elements heavier than silver. In order to fit the calculated curve with the observed abundances' it is necessary to assume thy integral of p"dt during the building-up period is equal to 5 X104 g sec./cm'. On the other hand, according to the relativistic theory of the expanding universe4 the density dependence on time is given by p-10'/t~. Since the integral of this expression diverges at t = 0, it is necessary to assume that the building-up process began at a certain time to, satisfying the relation: J (10'jt')dt =5 X 104, &0 (2) CAt ClMlKO-2 which gives us to=20 sec. and p0=2. 5)&105 g sec./cm'.

The purpose of the present note is to report that, as a consequence of this coupling, the spin-one quanta of some of the gauge fields acquire mass; the longitudinal degrees of freedom of these particles (which would be absent if their mass were zero) go over into the Goldstone bosons when the coupling tends to zero. This phenomenon is just the relativistic analog of the plasmon phenomenon to which Anderson' has drawn attention: that the scalar zero-mass excitations of a super-conducting neutral Fermi gas become longitudinal plasmon modes of finite mass when the gas is charged.

   abstract = {The standard model of hot big-bang cosmology requires initial conditions which are problematic in two ways: (1) The early universe is assumed to be highly homogeneous, in spite of the fact that separated regions were causally disconnected (horizon problem); and (2) the initial value of the Hubble constant must be fine tuned to extraordinary accuracy to produce a universe as flat (i.e., near critical mass density) as the one we see today (flatness problem). These problems would disappear if, in its early history, the universe supercooled to temperatures 28 or more orders of magnitude below the critical temperature for some phase transition. A huge expansion factor would then result from a period of exponential growth, and the entropy of the universe would be multiplied by a huge factor when the latent heat is released. Such a scenario is completely natural in the context of grand unified models of elementary-particle interactions. In such models, the supercooling is also relevant to the problem of monopole suppression. Unfortunately, the scenario seems to lead to some unacceptable consequences, so modifications must be sought. © 1981 The American Physical Society.},

The dynamics are also central to the behaviour of the growth of large-scale structure, offering the possibility that observations of structure formation provide a sensitive probe of the cosmology and dark energy characteristics. In particular, dark energy with a time-varying equation of state can have an influence on structure formation stretching back well into the matter-dominated epoch. We analyse this impact, first calculating the linear perturbation results, including those for weak gravitational lensing. These dynamical models possess definite observable differences from constant equation of state models. Then we present a large-scale numerical simulation of structure formation, including the largest volume to date involving a time-varying equation of state. We find the halo mass function is well described by the Jenkins et al. mass function formula. We also show how to interpret modifications of the Friedmann equation in terms of a time-variable equation of state. The results presented here provide steps toward realistic computation of the effect of dark energy in cosmological probes involving large-scale structure, such as cluster counts, the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect or weak gravitational lensing.},

   abstract = {We introduce the Virgo Consortium's Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE) project, a suite of hydrodynamical simulations that follow the formation of galaxies and supermassive black holes in cosmologically representative volumes of a standard Λ cold dark matter universe. We discuss the limitations of such simulations in light of their finite resolution and poorly constrained subgrid physics, and how these affect their predictive power. One major improvement is our treatment of feedback from massive stars and active galactic nuclei (AGN) in which thermal energy is injected into the gas without the need to turn off cooling or decouple hydrodynamical forces, allowing winds to develop without predetermined speed or mass loading factors. Because the feedback efficiencies cannot be predicted from first principles, we calibrate them to the present-day galaxy stellar mass function and the amplitude of the galaxy-central black hole mass relation, also taking galaxy sizes into account. The observed galaxy stellar mass function is reproduced to ≲0.2 dex over the full resolved mass range, 108 < M*/M⊙ ≲ 1011, a level of agreement close to that attained by semi-analytic models, and unprecedented for hydrodynamical simulations. We compare our results to a representative set of low-redshift observables not considered in the calibration, and find good agreement with the observed galaxy specific star formation rates, passive fractions, Tully-Fisher relation, total stellar luminosities of galaxy clusters, and column density distributions of intergalactic C IV and O VI. While the mass-metallicity relations for gas and stars are consistent with observations for M* ≳ 109 M⊙ (M* ≳ 1010 M⊙ at intermediate resolution), they are insufficiently steep at lower masses. For the reference model, the gas fractions and temperatures are too high for clusters of galaxies, but for galaxy groups these discrepancies can be resolved by adopting a higher heating temperature in the subgrid prescription for AGN feedback. The EAGLE simulation suite, which also includes physics variations and higher resolution zoomed-in volumes described elsewhere, constitutes a valuable new resource for studies of galaxy formation.},

   abstract = {Most of the mass in the universe is in the form of dark matter-a new type of nonbaryonic particle not yet detected in the laboratory or in other detection experiments. The evidence for the existence of dark matter through its gravitational impact is clear in astronomical observations-from the early observations of the large motions of galaxies in clusters and the motions of stars and gas in galaxies, to observations of the large-scale structure in the universe, gravitational lensing, and the cosmic microwave background. The extensive data consistently show the dominance of dark matter and quantify its amount and distribution, assuming general relativity is valid. The data inform us that the dark matter is nonbaryonic, is "cold" (i.e., moves nonrelativistically in the early universe), and interacts only weakly with matter other than by gravity. The current Lambda cold dark matter cosmology-a simple (but strange) flat cold dark matter model dominated by a cosmological constant Lambda, with only six basic parameters (including the density of matter and of baryons, the initial mass fluctuations amplitude and its scale dependence, and the age of the universe and of the first stars)-fits remarkably well all the accumulated data. However, what is the dark matter? This is one of the most fundamental open questions in cosmology and particle physics. Its existence requires an extension of our current understanding of particle physics or otherwise point to a modification of gravity on cosmological scales. The exploration and ultimate detection of dark matter are led by experiments for direct and indirect detection of this yet mysterious particle.},

   abstract = {The cold dark matter (CDM) cosmological model has been remarkably successful in explaining cosmic structure over an enormous span of redshift, but it has faced persistent challenges from observations that probe the innermost regions of dark matter halos and the properties of the Milky Way's dwarf galaxy satellites. We review the current observational and theoretical status of these "small-scale controversies." Cosmological simulations that incorporate only gravity and collisionless CDM predict halos with abundant substructure and central densities that are too high to match constraints from galaxy dynamics. The solution could lie in baryonic physics: Recent numerical simulations and analytical models suggest that gravitational potential fluctuations tied to efficient supernova feedback can flatten the central cusps of halos in massive galaxies, and a combination of feedback and low star formation efficiency could explain why most of the dark matter subhalos orbiting the Milky Way do not host visible galaxies. However, it is not clear that this solution can work in the lowest mass galaxies, where discrepancies are observed. Alternatively, the small-scale conflicts could be evidence of more complex physics in the dark sector itself. For example, elastic scattering from strong dark matter self-interactions can alter predicted halo mass profiles, leading to good agreement with observations across a wide range of galaxy mass. Gravitational lensing and dynamical perturbations of tidal streams in the stellar halo provide evidence for an abundant population of low-mass subhalos in accord with CDM predictions. These observational approaches will get more powerful over the next few years.},

The effort to explain this current state has focused attention on cosmological models in which the dominant component of the cosmic energy density has negative pressure, with an equation of state w ≥ -1. Remarking that most observations are consistent with models right up to the w= -1 or cosmological constant (Λ) limit, it is natural to ask what lies on the other side, at w < -1. In this regard, we construct a toy model of a "phantom" energy component which possesses an equation of state w < -1. Such a component is found to be compatible with most classical tests of cosmology based on current data, including the recent type 1a SNe data as well as the cosmic microwave background anisotropy and mass power spectrum. If the future observations continue to allow w < - 1, then barring unanticipated systematic effects, the dominant component of the cosmic energy density may be stranger than anything expected. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

   abstract = {We introduce a large class of scalar-tensor models with interactions containing the second derivatives of the scalar field but not leading to additional degrees of freedom. These models exhibit peculiar features, such as an essential mixing of scalar and tensor kinetic terms, which we have named kinetic braiding. This braiding causes the scalar stress tensor to deviate from the perfect-fluid form. Cosmology in these models possesses a rich phenomenology, even in the limit where the scalar is an exact Goldstone boson. Generically, there are attractor solutions where the scalar monitors the behaviour of external matter. Because of the kinetic braiding, the position of the attractor depends both on the form of the Lagrangian and on the external energy density. The late-time asymptotic of these cosmologies is a de Sitter state. The scalar can exhibit phantom behaviour and is able to cross the phantom divide with neither ghosts nor gradient instabilities. These features provide a new class of models for Dark Energy. As an example, we study in detail a simple one-parameter model. The possible observational signatures of this model include a sizeable Early Dark Energy and a specific equation of state evolving into the final de-Sitter state from a healthy phantom regime. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA.},

   abstract = {The case of a coupling between dark energy and matter [coupled quintessence (CQ)] or gravity [extended quintessence (EQ)] has recently attracted a deep interest and has been widely investigated both in the Einstein and in the Jordan frames (EF, JF), within scalar-tensor theories. Focusing on the simplest models proposed so far, in this paper we study the relation existing between the two scenarios, isolating the Weyl scaling which allows one to express them in the EF and JF. Moreover, we perform a comparative study of the behavior of linear perturbations in both scenarios, which turn out to behave in a markedly different way. In particular, while the clustering is enhanced in the considered CQ models with respect to the corresponding quintessence ones where the coupling is absent and to the ordinary cosmologies with a cosmological constant and cold dark matter (ΛCDM), structures in EQ models may grow slower. This is likely to have direct consequences on the inner properties of nonlinear structures, like cluster concentration, as well as on the weak lensing shear on large scales.

   abstract = {There is now strong observational evidence that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating. The standard explanation invokes an unknown "dark energy" component. But such scenarios are faced with serious theoretical problems, which has led to increased interest in models where instead general relativity is modified in a way that leads to the observed accelerated expansion. The question then arises whether the two scenarios can be distinguished. Here we show that this may not be so easy, demonstrating explicitly that a generalized dark energy model can match the growth rate of the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati model and reproduce the 3+1 dimensional metric perturbations. Cosmological observations are then unable to distinguish the two cases. © 2007 The American Physical Society.},

   abstract = {Dark energy with the equation of state w(z) rapidly evolving from the dustlike (w ≃ 0 at z ∼ 1) to the phantomlike (- 1.2 ≲ w ≲ -1 at z ≃ 0) has been recently proposed as the best fit for the supernovae Ia data. Assuming that a dark energy component with an arbitrary scalar-field Lagrangian p(φ, ▽<inf>μ</inf>φ) dominates in the flat Friedmann universe, we analyze the possibility of a dynamical transition from the states (φ, φ<sup>.</sup>) with w ≥ -1 to those with w < -1 or vice versa. We have found that generally such transitions are physically implausible because they are either realized by a discrete set of trajectories in the phase space or are unstable with respect to the cosmological perturbations. This conclusion is confirmed by a comparison of the analytic results with numerical solutions obtained for simple models. Without the assumption of the dark energy domination, this result still holds for a certain class of dark energy Lagrangians, in particular, for Lagrangians quadratic in ▽ <inf>μ</inf>φ. The result is insensitive to topology of the Friedmann universe as well. © 2005 The American Physical Society.},

   abstract = {A new component of the cosmic medium, a light scalar field or “quintessence,” has been proposed recently to explain cosmic acceleration with a dynamical cosmological constant. Such a field is expected to be coupled explicitly to ordinary matter, unless some unknown symmetry prevents it. I investigate the cosmological consequences of a coupled quintessence (CQ) model, assuming an exponential potential and a linear coupling. This model is conformally equivalent to Brans-Dicke Lagrangians with any power-law potential. I evaluate the density perturbations on the cosmic microwave background and on the galaxy distribution at the present and derive bounds on the coupling constant from the comparison with observational data. A novel feature of CQ is that during the matter dominated era the scalar field has a finite and almost constant energy density. This epoch, denoted as φMDE, is a saddle point in the dynamical phase space. The φMDE is responsible of several differences with respect to uncoupled quintessence: the multipole spectrum of the microwave background is tilted at large angles, the acoustic peaks are shifted, their amplitude is changed, and the present 8 Mpc/h density variance is diminished. The present data constrain the dimensionless coupling constant to (Formula presented) assuming (Formula presented) and a primordial fluctuation slope (Formula presented). © 2000 The American Physical Society.},

   abstract = { We use the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to reduce the uncertainty in the local value of the Hubble constant from 3.3% to 2.4%. The bulk of this improvement comes from new near-infrared (NIR) observations of Cepheid variables in 11 host galaxies of recent type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), more than doubling the sample of reliable SNe Ia having a Cepheid-calibrated distance to a total of 19; these in turn leverage the magnitude-redshift relation based on ∼300 SNe Ia at z  < 0.15. All 19 hosts as well as the megamaser system NGC 4258 have been observed with WFC3 in the optical and NIR, thus nullifying cross-instrument zeropoint errors in the relative distance estimates from Cepheids. Other noteworthy improvements include a 33% reduction in the systematic uncertainty in the maser distance to NGC 4258, a larger sample of Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), a more robust distance to the LMC based on late-type detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs), HST observations of Cepheids in M31, and new HST -based trigonometric parallaxes for Milky Way (MW) Cepheids. We consider four geometric distance calibrations of Cepheids: (i) megamasers in NGC 4258, (ii) 8 DEBs in the LMC, (iii) 15 MW Cepheids with parallaxes measured with HST /FGS, HST /WFC3 spatial scanning and/or Hipparcos , and (iv) 2 DEBs in M31. The Hubble constant from each is 72.25 ± 2.51, 72.04 ± 2.67, 76.18 ± 2.37, and 74.50 ± 3.27 km s −1 Mpc −1 , respectively. Our best estimate of H 0  = 73.24 ± 1.74 km s −1 Mpc −1 combines the anchors NGC 4258, MW, and LMC, yielding a 2.4% determination (all quoted uncertainties include fully propagated statistical and systematic components). This value is 3.4 σ higher than 66.93 ± 0.62 km s −1 Mpc −1 predicted by ΛCDM with 3 neutrino flavors having a mass of 0.06 eV and the new Planck data, but the discrepancy reduces to 2.1 σ relative to the prediction of 69.3 ± 0.7 km s −1 Mpc −1 based on the comparably precise combination of WMAP +ACT+SPT+BAO observations, suggesting that systematic uncertainties in CMB radiation measurements may play a role in the tension. If we take the conflict between Planck high-redshift measurements and our local determination of H 0 at face value, one plausible explanation could involve an additional source of dark radiation in the early universe in the range of Δ N eff  ≈ 0.4–1. We anticipate further significant improvements in H 0 from upcoming parallax measurements of long-period MW Cepheids. },

   abstract = {We report measurements of the mass density, Omega_M, and cosmological-constant energy density, Omega_Lambda, of the universe based on the analysis of 42 Type Ia supernovae discovered by the Supernova Cosmology Project. The magnitude-redshift data for these SNe, at redshifts between 0.18 and 0.83, are fit jointly with a set of SNe from the Calan/Tololo Supernova Survey, at redshifts below 0.1, to yield values for the cosmological parameters. All SN peak magnitudes are standardized using a SN Ia lightcurve width-luminosity relation. The measurement yields a joint probability distribution of the cosmological parameters that is approximated by the relation 0.8 Omega_M - 0.6 Omega_Lambda ~= -0.2 +/- 0.1 in the region of interest (Omega_M <~ 1.5). For a flat (Omega_M + Omega_Lambda = 1) cosmology we find Omega_M = 0.28\{+0.09,-0.08\} (1 sigma statistical) \{+0.05,-0.04\} (identified systematics). The data are strongly inconsistent with a Lambda = 0 flat cosmology, the simplest inflationary universe model. An open, Lambda = 0 cosmology also does not fit the data well: the data indicate that the cosmological constant is non-zero and positive, with a confidence of P(Lambda > 0) = 99%, including the identified systematic uncertainties. The best-fit age of the universe relative to the Hubble time is t_0 = 14.9\{+1.4,-1.1\} (0.63/h) Gyr for a flat cosmology. The size of our sample allows us to perform a variety of statistical tests to check for possible systematic errors and biases. We find no significant differences in either the host reddening distribution or Malmquist bias between the low-redshift Calan/Tololo sample and our high-redshift sample. The conclusions are robust whether or not a width-luminosity relation is used to standardize the SN peak magnitudes.},

   abstract = {We present observations of 10 type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) between 0.16 < z < 0.62. With previous data from our High-Z Supernova Search Team, this expanded set of 16 high-redshift supernovae and 34 nearby supernovae are used to place constraints on the Hubble constant (H_0), the mass density (Omega_M), the cosmological constant (Omega_Lambda), the deceleration parameter (q_0), and the dynamical age of the Universe (t_0). The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10% to 15% farther than expected in a low mass density (Omega_M=0.2) Universe without a cosmological constant. Different light curve fitting methods, SN Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor eternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e., Omega_Lambda > 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q_0 < 0). With no prior constraint on mass density other than Omega_M > 0, the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are consistent with q_0 <0 at the 2.8 sigma and 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with Omega_Lambda >0 at the 3.0 sigma and 4.0 sigma confidence levels, for two fitting methods respectively. Fixing a ``minimal'' mass density, Omega_M=0.2, results in the weakest detection, Omega_Lambda>0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level. For a flat-Universe prior (Omega_M+Omega_Lambda=1), the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require Omega_Lambda >0 at 7 sigma and 9 sigma level for the two fitting methods. A Universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega_M=1) is ruled out at the 7 sigma to 8 sigma level. We estimate the size of systematic errors, including evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local flows, gravitational lensing, and sample contamination. Presently, none of these effects reconciles the data with Omega_Lambda=0 and q_0 > 0.},

   abstract = {We present a model for the distribution of void sizes and its evolution in the context of hierarchical scenarios of gravitational structure formation. We find that at any cosmic epoch the voids have a size distribution that is well-peaked about a characteristic void size that evolves self-similarly in time. This is in distinct contrast to the distribution of virialized halo masses, which does not have a small-scale cut-off. In our model, the fate of voids is ruled by two processes. The first process affects those voids which are embedded in larger underdense regions: the evolution is effectively one in which a larger void is made up by the mergers of smaller voids, and is analogous to how massive clusters form from the mergers of less massive progenitors. The second process is unique to voids, and occurs to voids that happen to be embedded within a larger-scale overdensity: these voids get squeezed out of existence as the overdensity collapses around them. It is this second process which produces the cut-off at small scales. In the excursion set formulation of cluster abundance and evolution, the solution of the cloud-in-cloud problem, i.e. counting as clusters only those objects which are not embedded in larger clusters, requires the study of random walks crossing one barrier. We show that a similar formulation of void evolution requires the study of a two-barrier problem: one barrier is required to account for voids-in-voids, and the other for voids-in-clouds. Thus, in our model, the void size distribution is a function of two parameters, one of which reflects the dynamics of void formation, and the other the formation of collapsed objects.},

Within the context of the excursion set formulation of an evolving void hierarchy is one involving a two-barrier excursion problem, unlike the one-barrier problem for the dark halo evolution. This leads to voids having a peaked size distribution at any cosmic epoch, centered on a characteristic void size that evolves self-similarly in time, in distinct contrast to the distribution of virialized halo masses in not having a small-scale cut-off.To search for other articles by the author(s) go to: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html},

   abstract = {The possibility of measuring the density parameter Ω0 and the cosmological constant λ0 = Λ/(3H20) using dynamical tests is explored in linear and non-linear theory. In linear theory we find that the rate of growth of the perturbations at the present epoch is approximated by f(z = 0)≈Ω0.60 + 1/70 λ0(1 + 1/2 Ω0). Therefore, dynamical tests such as infall around clusters and dipoles at the present epoch do not distinguish well between universes with and without a cosmological constant. At higher redshifts, the perturbations also depend mainly on the matter density at a particular epoch, f(z) ≈ Ω0.6(z), which has a strong dependence on λ0 at z≈ 0.5-2.0. Therefore, information on both parameters can be obtained by looking at clustering at different redshifts. In practice, however, the other observables also depend on the cosmology, and in some cases conspire to give a weak dependence on λ0. By using the non-linear spherical infall model for a family of Cold Dark Matter (CDM) power-spectra we also find that dynamics at z = 0 does not tell much about λ0. At higher redshifts there is unfortunately another conspiracy between conventional observables, which hides information about λ0. The final radius of a virialized cluster (relative to the turnaround radius) is approximated by Rf/Rta ≈ (1 - η/2)/(2-η/2), where η is the ratio of Λ to the density at turn-around. Therefore a repulsive Λ gives a smaller final radius than a vanishing Λ.},

Light curves, spectra, classifications, and ancillary data are presented for 10,258 variable and transient sources discovered through repeat ugriz imaging of SDSS Stripe 82, a 300deg2 area along the celestial equator. This data release is comprised of all transient sources brighter than r ≃ 22.5 mag with no history of variability prior to 2004. Dedicated spectroscopic observations were performed on a subset of 889 transients, as well as spectra for thousands of transient host galaxies using the SDSS-III BOSS spectrographs. Photometric classifications are provided for the candidates with good multi-color light curves that were not observed spectroscopically, using host galaxy redshift information when available. From these observations, 4607 transients are either spectroscopically confirmed, or likely to be, supernovae, making this the largest sample of supernova candidates ever compiled. We present a new method for SN host-galaxy identification and derive host-galaxy properties including stellar masses, star formation rates, and the average stellar population ages from our SDSS multi-band photometry. We derive SALT2 distance moduli for a total of 1364 SNIa with spectroscopic redshifts as well as photometric redshifts for a further 624 purely photometric SNIa candidates. Using the spectroscopically confirmed subset of the three-year SDSS-II SNIa sample and assuming a flat ΛCDM cosmology, we determine ΩM = 0.315 ± 0.093 (statistical error only) and detect a non-zero cosmological constant at 5.7σ.},

   abstract = {Hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation have now reached sufficient volume to make precision predictions for clustering on cosmologically relevant scales. Here, we use our new IllustrisTNG simulations to study the non-linear correlation functions and power spectra of baryons, dark matter, galaxies, and haloes over an exceptionally large range of scales. We find that baryonic effects increase the clustering of dark matter on small scales and damp the total matter power spectrum on scales up to k ~ 10 h Mpc-1 by 20 per cent. The non-linear two-point correlation function of the stellar mass is close to a power-law over a wide range of scales and approximately invariant in time from very high redshift to the present. The two-point correlation function of the simulated galaxies agrees well with Sloan Digital Sky Survey at its mean redshift z ≃ 0.1, both as a function of stellar mass and when split according to galaxy colour, apart from a mild excess in the clustering of red galaxies in the stellar mass range of109-1010 h-2Mo˙. Given this agreement, the TNG simulations can make valuable theoretical predictions for the clustering bias of different galaxy samples. We find that the clustering length of the galaxy autocorrelation function depends strongly on stellar mass and redshift. Its power-law slope γ is nearly invariant with stellar mass, but declines from γ ~ 1.8 at redshift z = 0 to γ ~ 1.6 at redshift z ~ 1, beyond which the slope steepens again. We detect significant scale dependences in the bias of different observational tracers of largescale structure, extending well into the range of the baryonic acoustic oscillations and causing nominal (yet fortunately correctable) shifts of the acoustic peaks of around ~5 per cent.},

   abstract = {We present an analysis of the clustering evolution of dark matter in four cold dark matter (CDM) cosmologies. We use a suite of high resolution, 17-million particle, N-body simulations which sample volumes large enough to give clustering statistics with unprecedented accuracy. We investigate both a flat and an open model with Omega_0=0.3, and two models with Omega=1, one with the standard CDM power spectrum and the other with the same power spectrum as the Omega_0=0.3 models. The amplitude of primordial fluctuations is set so that the models reproduce the observed abundance of rich galaxy clusters by the present day. The mass 2-point correlation function and power spectrum of all the simulations differ significantly from those of the observed galaxy distribution, in both shape and amplitude. Thus, for any of these models to provide an acceptable representation of reality, the distribution of galaxies must be biased relative to the mass in a non-trivial, scale-dependent, fashion. In the Omega=1 models the required bias is always greater than unity, but in the Omega_0=0.3 models an "antibias" is required on scales smaller than \sim 5\hmpc. The mass correlation functions in the simulations are well fit by recently published analytic models. The velocity fields are remarkably similar in all the models, whether they be characterised as bulk flows, 1-particle or pairwise velocity dispersions. This similarity is a direct consequence of our adopted normalisation. The small-scale pairwise velocity dispersion of the dark matter is somewhat larger than recent determinations from galaxy redshift surveys, but the bulk-flows predicted by our models are broadly in agreement with most available data.},

   abstract = {A method to rapidly estimate the Fourier power spectrum of a point distribution is presented. This method relies on a Taylor expansion of the trigonometric functions. It yields the Fourier modes from a number of fast Fourier transforms (FFTs), which is controlled by the order N of the expansion and by the dimension D of the system. In three dimensions, for the practical value N = 3, the number of FFTs required is 20. We apply the method to the measurement of the power spectrum of a periodic point distribution that is a local Poisson realization of an underlying stationary field. We derive an explicit analytic expression for the spectrum, which allows us to quantify - and correct for - the biases induced by discreteness and by the truncation of the Taylor expansion, and to bound the unknown effects of aliasing of the power spectrum. We show that these aliasing effects decrease rapidly with the order N. For N = 3, they are expected to be, respectively, smaller than ∼10 -4 and 0.02 at half the Nyquist frequency and at the Nyquist frequency of the grid used to perform the FFTs. The only remaining significant source of errors is reduced to the unavoidable cosmic/sample variance due to the finite size of the sample. The analytical calculations are successfully checked against a cosmological N-body experiment. We also consider the initial conditions of this simulation, which correspond to a perturbed grid. This allows us to test a case where the local Poisson assumption is incorrect. Even in that extreme situation, the third-order Fourier-Taylor estimator behaves well, with aliasing effects restrained to at most the per cent level at half the Nyquist frequency. We also show how to reach arbitrarily large dynamic range in Fourier space (i.e. high wavenumber), while keeping statistical errors in control, by appropriately 'folding' the particle distribution. © 2009 RAS.},

This structure of galaxies consists of rich and poor clusters, connected by filaments and sheets, with regions largely devoid of galaxies (voids) in between1. Numerical simulations of the growth of initial density fluctuations through a nonlinear regime, motivated by the likely physics of the early Universe, also show a network of filaments and voids2, 3, 18, but the origin of this picture of filaments as the dominant structure was not well understood. Here we show that the ‘web’ of filaments that defines the final state in these simulations is present in the initial density fluctuations; the pattern of the web is defined largely by the rare density peaks in the initial fluctuations, with the subsequent nonlinear evolution of the structure bringing the filamentary network into sharper relief. Applying these results to the observed galaxy distribution, we suggest that ‘superclusters’ are filamentary cluster–cluster bridges, and we predict that the most pronounced filaments will be found between clusters of galaxies that are aligned with each other and close together. © 1996, Nature Publishing Group.

   abstract = {The density profiles of dark matter haloes can potentially probe dynamics, fundamental physics, and cosmology, but some of the most promising signals reside near or beyond the virial radius. While these scales have recently become observable, the profiles at large radii are still poorly understood theoretically, chiefly because the distribution of orbiting matter (the one-halo term) is partially concealed by particles falling into haloes for the first time. We present an algorithm to dynamically disentangle the orbiting and infalling contributions by counting the pericentric passages of billions of simulation particles. We analyse dynamically split profiles out to 10 R200m across a wide range of halo mass, redshift, and cosmology. We show that the orbiting term experiences a sharp truncation at the edge of the orbit distribution. Its sharpness and position are mostly determined by the mass accretion rate, confirming that the entire profile shape primarily depends on halo dynamics and secondarily on mass, redshift, and cosmology. The infalling term also depends on the accretion rate for fast-accreting haloes but is mostly set by the environment for slowly accreting haloes, leading to a diverse array of shapes that does not conform to simple theoretical models. While the resulting scatter in the infalling term reaches 1 dex, the scatter in the orbiting term is only between 0.1 and 0.4 dex and almost independent of radius. We demonstrate a tight correspondence between the redshift evolution in Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) and the slope of the matter power spectrum. Our code and data are publicly available.},

   abstract = {<p>In the previous paper of this series, we proposed a new function to fit halo density profiles out to large radii. This truncated Einasto profile models the inner, orbiting matter as $\rho _\{\rm orb\}\propto \exp \left[-2/\alpha \ (r / r_\{\rm s\})^\alpha - 1/\beta \ (r / r_\{\rm t\})^\beta \right]$ and the outer, infalling term as a power-law overdensity. In this paper, we analyse the resulting parameter space of scale radius $r_\{\rm s\}$, truncation radius $r_\{\rm t\}$, steepening $\alpha$, truncation sharpness $\beta$, infalling normalization $\delta _\{\rm 1\}$, and infalling slope s. We show that these parameters are non-degenerate in averaged profiles, and that fits to the total profiles generally recover the underlying properties of the orbiting and infalling terms. We study the connection between profile parameters and halo properties such as mass (or peak height) and accretion rate. We find that the commonly cited dependence of $\alpha$ on peak height is an artefact of fitting Einasto profiles to the actual, truncated profiles. In our fits, $\alpha$ is independent of mass but dependent on accretion rate. When fitting individual halo profiles, the parameters exhibit significant scatter but otherwise follow the same trends. We confirm that the entire profiles are sensitive to the accretion history of haloes, and that the two radial scales $r_\{\rm s\}$ and $r_\{\rm t\}$ particularly respond to the formation time and recent accretion rate. As a result, $r_\{\rm t\}$ is a more accurate measure of the accretion rate than the commonly used radius where the density slope is steepest.</p>},

The orbiting term is described as a truncated Einasto profile, ρorb exp [- 2/α (r/rs)α - 1/β (r/rt)β], with a five-parameter space of normalization, physically distinct scale and truncation radii, and α and β, which control how rapidly the profiles steepen. The infalling profile is modelled as a power law in overdensity that smoothly transitions to a constant at the halo centre. We show that these formulae fit the averaged total profiles in simulations to about 5 per cent accuracy across almost all of an expansive parameter space in halo mass, redshift, cosmology, and accretion rate. When fixing α = 0.18 and β = 3, the formula becomes a three-parameter model that fits individual haloes better than the Einasto profile on average. By analogy with King profiles, we show that the sharp truncation resembles a cut-off in binding energy.},

   abstract = {In the local Universe, galaxies in groups and clusters contain less gas and are less likely to be forming stars than their field counterparts. This effect is not limited to the central group/cluster regions, but is shown by recent observations to persist out to several virial radii. To gain insight into the extent and cause of this large-scale environmental influence, we use a suite of high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to analyse galaxies around simulated groups and clusters of a wide range of mass (log10Mhost/M⊙ = [13.0, 15.2]). In qualitative agreement with the observations, we find a systematic depletion of both hot and cold gas and a decline in the star-forming fraction of galaxies as far out as ~5r200 from the host centre. A substantial fraction of these galaxies are on highly elliptical orbits and are not infalling for the first time (~50 per cent at 2r200, independent of host mass) or are affected by @'preprocessing' (less than 10 per cent of galaxies around groups, increasing to ~50 per cent near a massive cluster), even a combination of these indirect mechanisms does not fully account for the environmental influence, particularly in the case of the hot gas content. Direct ram pressure interaction with an extended gas 'halo' surrounding groups and clusters is shown to be sufficiently strong to strip the hot gas atmospheres of infalling galaxies out to ~5r200. We show that this influence is highly anisotropic, with ram pressure along filaments enhanced by up to a factor of 100 despite significant co-flow of gas and galaxies. © 2013 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

   abstract = {The observable properties of galaxies depend on both internal processes and the external environment. In terms of the environmental role, we still do not have a clear picture of the processes driving the transformation of galaxies. The use of proxies for environment (e.g. host halo mass, distance to the Nth nearest neighbour, etc.), as opposed to the real physical conditions (e.g. hot-gas density) may bear some responsibility for this. Here, we propose a new method that directly links galaxies to their local environments, by using spatial cross-correlations of galaxy catalogues with maps from large-scale structure surveys [e.g. thermal Sunyaev–Zel’dovich (tSZ) effect, diffuse X-ray emission, weak lensing of galaxies, or the cosmic microwave background (CMB)]. We focus here on the quenching of galaxies and its link to local hot gas properties. Maps of galaxy overdensity and quenched fraction excess are constructed from volume-limited Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) catalogues, which are cross-correlated with tSZ effect and X-ray maps from Planck and ROSAT, respectively. Strong signals out to Mpc scales are detected for most cross-correlations and are compared to predictions from the Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE) and BAryons and Haloes of MAssive Systems (BAHAMAS) cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. The simulations successfully reproduce many, but not all, of the observed power spectra, with an indication that environmental quenching may be too efficient in the simulations. We demonstrate that the cross-correlations are sensitive to both the internal [e.g. active galactic nucleus (AGN) and stellar feedback] and external processes (e.g. ram pressure stripping, harassment, strangulation, etc.) responsible for quenching. The methods outlined in this paper can be adapted to other observables and, with upcoming surveys, will provide a stringent test of physical models for environmental transformation.},

   abstract = { We measure the projected number density profiles of galaxies and the splashback feature in clusters selected by the Sunyaev–Zel’dovich effect from the Advanced Atacama Cosmology Telescope (AdvACT) survey using galaxies observed by the Dark Energy Survey (DES). The splashback radius is consistent with CDM-only simulations and is located at        2.4   − 0.4   + 0.3    Mpc    h   − 1      . We split the galaxies on color and find significant differences in their profile shapes. Red and green-valley galaxies show a splashback-like minimum in their slope profile consistent with theory, while the bluest galaxies show a weak feature at a smaller radius. We develop a mapping of galaxies to subhalos in simulations and assign colors based on infall time onto their hosts. We find that the shift in location of the steepest slope and different profile shapes can be mapped to the average time of infall of galaxies of different colors. The steepest slope traces a discontinuity in the phase space of dark matter halos. By relating spatial profiles to infall time, we can use splashback as a clock to understand galaxy quenching. We find that red galaxies have on average been in clusters over 3.2 Gyr, green galaxies about 2.2 Gyr, while blue galaxies have been accreted most recently and have not reached apocenter. Using the full radial profiles, we fit a simple quenching model and find that the onset of galaxy quenching occurs after a delay of about a gigayear and that galaxies quench rapidly thereafter with an exponential timescale of 0.6 Gyr. },

   abstract = {We investigate the recent and current star formation activity of galaxies as function of distance from the cluster centre in a sample of 521 Sloan Digital Sky Survey clusters at z < 0.1. We characterize the recent star formation history (SFH) by the strength of the 4000 Å break and the strength of the Balmer absorption lines, and thus probe the SFH over the last ∼2 Gyr. We show that when the brightest cluster galaxies are excluded from the galaxy sample, there is no evidence for mass segregation in the clusters, so that differences in cluster and field populations cannot simply be attributed to different mass functions. We find a marked star formation-radius relation in that almost all galaxies in the cluster core are quiescent, i.e. have terminated star formation a few Gyr ago. This star formation-radius relation is most pronounced for low-mass galaxies and is very weak or absent beyond the virial radius. The typical star formation rate (SFR) of non-quiescent galaxies declines by approximately a factor of 2 towards the cluster centre. However, the fraction of galaxies with young stellar populations indicating a recently completed starburst or a truncation of star formation does not vary significantly with radius. These results favour a scenario in which star formation is quenched slowly, on time-scales similar to the cluster crossing time, i.e. a few Gyr. The fraction of star-forming galaxies which host a powerful optical active galactic nucleus (AGN) is also independent of clustercentric radius, indicating that the link between star formation and AGN in these galaxies operates independent of environment. The fraction of red galaxies which host a weak optical AGN decreases, however, towards the cluster centre, with a similar time-scale as the decline of star-forming galaxies. Our results can be fully explained by a gradual decline of SFR upon infall into the cluster, and rule out significant contributions from more violent processes, at least beyond cluster radii ≳0.1R200. © 2010 The Authors.

   abstract = {Using galaxy group/cluster catalogues created from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7, we examine in detail the specific star formation rate (SSFR) distribution of satellite galaxies and its dependence on stellar mass, host halo mass and halo-centric radius. All galaxies, regardless of central satellite designation, exhibit a similar bimodal SSFR distribution, with a strong break at SSFR ≈ 10-11yr-1 and the same high SSFR peak; in no regime is there ever an excess of galaxies in the 'green valley'. Satellite galaxies are simply more likely to lie on the quenched ('red sequence') side of the SSFR distribution. Furthermore, the satellite quenched fraction excess above the field galaxy value is nearly independent of galaxy stellar mass. An enhanced quenched fraction for satellites persists in groups with halo masses down to 3 × 1011M⊙ and increases strongly with halo mass and towards halo centre. We find no detectable quenching enhancement for galaxies beyond ∼2Rvir around massive clusters once these galaxies have been decomposed into centrals and satellites. These trends imply that (1) galaxies experience no significant environmental effects until they cross within ∼Rvir of a more massive host halo; (2) after this, star formation in active satellites continues to evolve in the same manner as active central galaxies for several Gyr; and (3) once begun, satellite star formation quenching occurs rapidly. These results place strong constraints on satellite-specific quenching mechanisms, as we will discuss further in companion papers. © 2012 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society © 2012 RAS.},

Using N-body simulations, we model the distribution of the kinematically distinct infalling and orbiting populations of subhaloes and haloes. We show that the two are mixed spatially all the way to redge, which extends past the splashback radius defined by the drop in the spherically averaged density profile. This edge radius can be interpreted as a radius that contains a fixed fraction of the apocentres of dark matter particles.

While these halo properties are not directly observable, galaxies will inherit their host haloes' correlations with environment. In this paper, we show how these characteristic environmental signatures allow using measurements of galaxy environment to constrain which dark matter halo properties are most tightly connected to observable galaxy properties. We show that different halo properties beyond mass imprint distinct scale-dependent signatures in both the galaxy two-point correlation function and the distribution of distances to galaxies' kth nearest neighbours, with features strong enough to be accessible even with low-resolution (e.g. grism) spectroscopy at higher redshifts. As an application, we compute observed two-point correlation functions for galaxies binned by half-mass radius at $z$ = 0 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, showing that classic galaxy size models (i.e. galaxy size being proportional to halo spin) as well as other recent proposals show significant tensions with observational data. We show that the agreement with observed clustering can be improved with a simple empirical model in which galaxy size correlates with halo growth.},

The method is constrained by galaxies’ observed stellar mass functions, SFRs (specific and cosmic), quenched fractions, ultraviolet (UV) luminosity functions, UV–stellar mass relations, IRX–UV relations, auto- and cross-correlation functions (including quenched and star-forming subsamples), and quenching dependence on environment; each observable is reproduced over the full redshift range available, up to 0 < z < 10. Key findings include the following: galaxy assembly correlates strongly with halo assembly; quenching correlates strongly with halo mass; quenched fractions at fixed halo mass decrease with increasing redshift; massive quenched galaxies reside in higher-mass haloes than star-forming galaxies at fixed galaxy mass; star-forming and quenched galaxies’ star formation histories at fixed mass differ most at z < 0.5; satellites have large scatter in quenching time-scales after infall, and have modestly higher quenched fractions than central galaxies; Planck cosmologies result in up to 0.3 dex lower stellar – halo mass ratios at early times; and, none the less, stellar mass–halo mass ratios rise at z > 5. Also presented are revised stellar mass – halo mass relations for all, quenched, star-forming, central, and satellite galaxies; the dependence of star formation histories on halo mass, stellar mass, and galaxy SSFR; quenched fractions and quenching time-scale distributions for satellites; and predictions for higher-redshift galaxy correlation functions and weak lensing surface densities.

We define the splashback radius of a halo as the smoothed average of the apocenter radii of individual particles. This definition allows us to reliably measure the splashback radii of 95% of host halos above a resolution limit of 1000 particles.

We also study the 3D structures of these shells and find that they generally have non-ellipsoidal oval shapes. We find that splashback radii estimated by Shellfish are 20%–30% larger than those estimated in previous studies from stacked density profiles at high accretion rates. We demonstrate that the latter are biased low owing to the contribution of high-mass subhalos to these profiles, and we show that using the median instead of mean density in each radial bin mitigates the effect of substructure on density profiles and removes the bias. },

   abstract = {In ΛCDM cosmology, structure formation is halted shortly after dark energy dominates the mass/energy budget of the Universe. A manifestation of this effect is that in such a cosmology the turnaround radius - the non-expanding mass shell furthest away from the center of a structure - has an upper bound. Recently, a new, local, test for the existence of dark energy in the form of a cosmological constant was proposed based on this turnaround bound. Before designing an experiment that, through high-precision determination of masses and - independently - turnaround radii, will challenge ΛCDM cosmology, we have to answer two important questions: first, when turnaround-scale structures are predicted to be close enough to their maximum size, so that a possible violation of the bound may be observable. Second, which is the best mass scale to target for possible violations of the bound. These are the questions we address in the present work. Using the Press-Schechter formalism, we find that turnaround structures have in practice already stopped forming, and consequently, the turnaround radius of structures must be very close to the maximum value today. We also find that the mass scale of ∼ 1013 Mo characterizes the turnaround structures that start to form in a statistically important number density today - and even at an infinite time in the future, since structure formation has almost stopped. This mass scale also separates turnaround structures with qualitatively different cosmological evolution: smaller structures are no longer readjusting their mass distribution inside the turnaround scale, they asymptotically approach their ultimate abundance from higher values, and they are common enough to have, at some epoch, experienced major mergers with structures of comparable mass; larger structures exhibit the opposite behavior. We call this mass scale the transitional mass scale and we argue that it is the optimal for the purpose outlined above. As a corollary, we explain the different accretion behavior of small and larger structures observed in already conducted numerical simulations.},

   abstract = {Our intuitive understanding of cosmic structure formation works best in scales small enough so that isolated, bound, relaxed gravitating systems are no longer adjusting their radius; and large enough so that space and matter follow the average expansion of the Universe. Yet one of the most robust predictions of ΛCDM cosmology concerns the scale that separates these limits: the turnaround radius, which is the non-expanding shell furthest away from the center of a bound structure. We show that the maximum possible value of the turnaround radius within the framework of the ΛCDM model is, for a given mass M, equal to (3GM/Λ c2)1/3, with G Newton's constant and c the speed of light, independently of cosmic epoch, exact nature of dark matter, or baryonic effects. We discuss the possible use of this prediction as an observational test for ΛCDM cosmology. Current data appear to favor ΛCDM over alternatives with local inhomogeneities and no Λ. However there exist several local-universe structures that have, within errors, reached their limiting size. With improved determinations of their turnaround radii and the enclosed mass, these objects may challenge the limit and ΛCDM cosmology.},

   abstract = {We investigate the buildup of the halo profile out to large scale in a cosmological simulation, focusing on the roles played by the recently proposed depletion radii. We explicitly show that halo growth is accompanied by the depletion of the environment, with the inner depletion radius demarcating the two. This evolution process is also observed via the formation of a trough in the bias profile, with the two depletion radii identifying key scales in the evolution. The ratio between the inner depletion radius and the virial radius is approximately a constant factor of 2 across redshifts and halo masses. The ratio between their enclosed densities is also close to a constant of 0.18. These simple scaling relations reflect the largely universal scaled mass profile on these scales, which only evolves weakly with redshift. The overall picture of the boundary evolution can be broadly divided into three stages according to the maturity of the depletion process, with cluster halos lagging behind low-mass ones in the evolution. We also show that the traditional slow and fast accretion dichotomy of halo growth can be identified as accelerated and decelerated depletion phases, respectively.},

   abstract = {We explore the boundary of dark matter haloes through their bias and velocity profiles. Using cosmological í µí±-body simulations, we show that the bias profile exhibits a ubiquitous trough that can be interpreted as created by halo accretion that depletes material around the boundary. The inner edge of the active depletion region is marked by the location of the maximum mass inflow rate that separates a growing halo from the draining environment. This inner depletion radius can also be interpreted as the radius enclosing a highly complete population of splashback orbits, and matches the optimal exclusion radius in a halo model of the large-scale structure. The minimum of the bias trough defines a characteristic depletion radius, which is located within the infall region bounded by the inner depletion radius and the turnaround radius, while approaching the turnaround radius in low mass haloes that have stopped mass accretion. The characteristic depletion radius depends the most on halo mass and environment. It is approximately 2.5 times the virial radius and encloses an average density of ∼ 40 times the background density of the universe, independent on halo mass but dependent on other halo properties. The inner depletion radius is smaller by 10 − 20% and encloses an average density of ∼ 63 times the background density. These radii open a new window for studying the properties of haloes.},

However, the method of least squares may be used without additional computational complexity and with considerable improvement in the information obtained. The least squares calculations may be carried out in the computer by convolution of the data points with properly chosen sets of integers. These sets of integers and their normalizing factors are described and their use is illustrated in spectroscopic applications. The computer programs required are relatively simple.

   abstract = {For any assumed standard stellar initial mass function, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) gives a precise determination of the abundance of galaxies as a function of their stellar mass over the full stellar mass range 108 M⊙ < M* < 1012 M⊙. Within the concordance Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmology, the Millennium Simulations give precise halo abundances as a function of mass and redshift for all haloes within which galaxies can form. Under the plausible hypothesis that the stellar mass of a galaxy is an increasing function of the maximum mass ever attained by its halo, these results combine to give halo mass as a function of stellar mass. The result agrees quite well with observational estimates of mean halo mass as a function of stellar mass from stacking analyses of the gravitational lensing signal and the satellite dynamics of SDSS galaxies. For M* ∼ 5.5 × 1010 M⊙, the stellar mass usually assumed for the Milky Way (MW), the implied halo mass is ∼2 × 1012 M⊙, consistent with most recent direct estimates and inferences from the MW/M31 timing argument. The fraction of the baryons associated with each halo which are present as stars in its central galaxy reaches a maximum of 20 per cent at masses somewhat below that of the MW and falls rapidly at both higher and lower masses. These conversion efficiencies are lower than in almost all recent high-resolution simulations of galaxy formation, showing that these are not yet viable models for the formation of typical members of the galaxy population. When inserted in the Millennium-II Simulation, our derived relation between stellar mass and halo mass predicts a stellar mass autocorrelation function in excellent agreement with that measured directly in the SDSS. The implied Tully-Fisher relation also appears consistent with observation, suggesting that galaxy luminosity functions and Tully-Fisher relations can be reproduced simultaneously in a ΛCDM cosmology. © 2010 The Authors.

Apart from a few detailed studies of such structures, their evolutionary mechanism is still an open question. In order to address and answer the relevant questions, a statistically significant, large catalog of superclusters covering a wide range of redshifts and sky areas is essential. Here, we present a large catalog of 662 superclusters identified using a modified friends-of-friends algorithm applied on the WHL (Wen–Han–Liu) cluster catalog within a redshift range of 0.05 ≤ z ≤ 0.42. We name the most massive supercluster at z ∼ 0.25 as the Einasto Supercluster . We find that the median mass of superclusters is ∼5.8 × 10 15 M ⊙ and the median size ∼65 Mpc. We find that the supercluster environment slightly affects the growth of clusters. We compare the properties of the observed superclusters with the mock superclusters extracted from the Horizon Run 4 cosmological simulation. The properties of the superclusters in the mocks and observations are in broad agreement. We find that the density contrast of a supercluster is correlated with its maximum extent with a power-law index, α ∼ −2. The phase-space distribution of mock superclusters shows that, on average, ∼90% of part of a supercluster has a gravitational influence on its constituents. We also show the mock halos’ average number density and peculiar velocity profiles in and around the superclusters. },

   abstract = { In the hierarchical evolution framework of cosmology, larger halos grow through matter accretion and halo mergers. To clarify halo evolution, we need to define the halo mass and radius physically. However, the pseudoevolution problem makes the process difficult. Thus, we aim to measure the splash-back radius ( R sp ), a physically defined halo radius for a large number of halos with various mass and redshift, and to determine the most important parameters that affect it. We use the typical definition of splash-back radius as the radius with the steepest radial density profile. In this work, we measure the splash-back radius of dark matter halos within the mass of 10 13 M ⊙ to 3 × 10 15 M ⊙ and redshifts spanning 0.08–0.65. This is the measurement of the R sp in the largest range of halo mass and redshift. Using the shear catalog of the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey Data Release 8, we investigate the splash-back radius of halos associated with galaxies and galaxy clusters identified in the various catalogs. Our finding reveals a trend wherein massive halos demonstrate a larger splash-back radius, and the normalized splash-back radius ( R sp / R 200m ) shows a U-shaped mass evolution. The upturn in these relations mainly comes from the contribution of massive halos with low redshifts. We further find the splash-back radius increases with the peak height, while the normalized splash-back radius has a negative relation with the peak height. We also find that R sp ≳ R 200m for most halos, indicating their low accretion rates. Our result is consistent with previous literature across a wide range of mass, redshift, and peak height, as well as the simulation work from More et al. },

Weak gravitational lensing offers a powerful method to investigate the projected matter density distribution within galaxy clusters, granting crucial insights into the broader landscape of dark matter on cluster scales. Aims. In this study, we make use of the large photometric galaxy cluster data set derived from the publicly available Third Data Release of the Kilo-Degree Survey, along with the associated shear signal. Our primary objective is to model the peculiar sharp transition in the cluster profile slope, that is what is commonly referred to as the splashback radius. The data set under scrutiny includes 6962 galaxy clusters, selected by AMICO - an optimised detection algorithm of galaxy clusters - on the KiDS-DR3 data, in the redshift range of 0.1 < z < 0.6, all observed at a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 3.5. Methods. Employing a comprehensive Bayesian analysis, we model the stacked excess surface mass density distribution of the clusters. We adopt a model from recent results on numerical simulations that capture the dynamics of both orbiting and infalling materials, separated by the region where the density profile slope undergoes a pronounced deepening. Results. We find that the adopted profile successfully characterizes the cluster masses, consistent with previous works, and models the deepening of the slope of the density profiles measured with weak-lensing data up to the outskirts. Moreover, we measure the splashback radius of galaxy clusters and show that its value is close to the radius within which the enclosed overdensity is 200 times the mean matter density of the Universe, while theoretical models predict a larger value consistent with a low accretion rate. This points to a potential bias of optically selected clusters preferentially characterized by a high density at small scales compared to a pure mass-selected cluster sample.},

We use a nearly volume-limited sample of 109 galaxy clusters selected in 0.5-2.0 keV band having luminosity LX > 1043.5 erg s−1 h−2 within the redshift z < 0.75 and obtain measurements of the projected cross-correlation with a signal to noise of 17.43.

We infer the value of the 3D splashback radius rsp = 1.45+−002630 h−1 Mpc.

   abstract = {We present measurements of the radial profiles of the mass and galaxy number density around Sunyaev–Zel’dovich (SZ)-selected clusters using both weak lensing and galaxy counts. The clusters are selected from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Data Release 5 and the galaxies from the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 data set. With signal-to-noise ratio of 62 (45) for galaxy (weak lensing) profiles over scales of about 0.2–20 h-1 Mpc, these are the highest precision measurements for SZ-selected clusters to date. Because SZ selection closely approximates mass selection, these measurements enable several tests of theoretical models of the mass and light distribution around clusters. Our main findings are: (1) The splashback feature is detected at a consistent location in both the mass and galaxy profiles and its location is consistent with predictions of cold dark matter N-body simulations. (2) The full mass profile is also consistent with the simulations. (3) The shapes of the galaxy and lensing profiles are remarkably similar for our sample over the entire range of scales, from well inside the cluster halo to the quasilinear regime. We measure the dependence of the profile shapes on the galaxy sample, redshift, and cluster mass. We extend the Diemer & Kravtsov model for the cluster profiles to the linear regime using perturbation theory and show that it provides a good match to the measured profiles. We also compare the measured profiles to predictions of the standard halo model and simulations that include hydrodynamics. Applications of these results to cluster mass estimation, cosmology, and astrophysics are discussed.},

We show that the deprojected cross-correlation of galaxy clusters found in the Planck survey with galaxies detected photometrically in the Pan-STARRS survey shows a sharp steepening feature (a logarithmic slope steeper than −3), which we associate with the splashback radius. We infer the 3D splashback radius for the SZ cluster sample to be             , where the cluster sample has an average halo mass of M  500 c   = 3.0 × 10 14       at an average redshift of z  = 0.18. The inferred value of the splashback radius appears marginally consistent with the expected location for dark matter halos in the standard cold dark matter paradigm. However, given the limited precision of our measurements, we cannot conclusively confirm or rule out the smaller splashback radius measured so far in the literature for optically selected galaxy clusters. We show that the splashback radius does not depend on the galaxy magnitude for galaxies fainter than       and is present at a consistent location in galaxy populations divided by color. The presence of the splashback radius in the star-forming galaxy population could potentially be used to put lower limits on the quenching timescales for galaxies. We can marginally rule out the contamination of the star-forming galaxy sample by quenched galaxies, but the results would need further verification with deeper data sets. },

Our stacking technique with a statistical background subtraction reveals color-magnitude diagrams of red-sequence and blue cluster galaxies down to faint magnitudes of mz ∼ 24. We find that the linear relation of red-sequence galaxies in the color-magnitude diagram extends down to the faintest magnitudes we explore with a small intrinsic scatter σint(g - r) < 0.1. The scatter does not evolve significantly with redshift. The stacked color-magnitude diagrams are used to define red and blue galaxies in clusters in order to study their radial number density profiles without resorting to photometric redshifts of individual galaxies. We find that red galaxies are significantly more concentrated toward cluster centers and blue galaxies dominate the outskirts of clusters. We explore the fraction of red galaxies in clusters as a function of redshift, and find that the red fraction decreases with increasing distances from cluster centers. The red fraction exhibits a moderate decrease with increasing redshift. The radial number density profiles of cluster member galaxies are also used to infer the location of the steepest slope in the three-dimensional galaxy density profiles. For a fixed threshold in richness, we find little redshift evolution in this location.},

   abstract = {Analytical models and simulations predict a rapid decline in the halo density profile associated with the transition from the “infalling” regime outside the halo to the “collapsed” regime within the halo. Using data from SDSS, we explore evidence for such a feature in the density profiles of galaxy clusters using several different approaches. We first estimate the steepening of the outer galaxy density profile around clusters, finding evidence for truncation of the halo profile. Next, we measure the galaxy density profile around clusters using two sets of galaxies selected on color. We find evidence of an abrupt change in galaxy colors that coincides with the location of the steepening of the density profile. Since galaxies that have completed orbits within the cluster are more likely to be quenched of star formation and thus appear redder, this abrupt change in galaxy color can be associated with the transition from single-stream to multi-stream regimes. We also use a standard model comparison approach to measure evidence for a “splashback”-like feature, but find that this approach is very sensitive to modeling assumptions. Finally, we perform measurements using an independent cluster catalog to test for potential systematic errors associated with cluster selection. We identify several avenues for future work: improved understanding of the small-scale galaxy profile, lensing measurements, identification of proxies for the halo accretion rate, and other tests. With upcoming data from the DES, KiDS, and HSC surveys, we can expect significant improvements in the study of halo boundaries.},

   abstract = { We show that the projected number density profiles of Sloan Digital Sky Survey photometric galaxies around galaxy clusters display strong evidence for the splashback radius, a sharp halo edge corresponding to the location of the first orbital apocenter of satellite galaxies after their infall. We split the clusters into two subsamples with different mean projected radial distances of their members,       , at fixed richness and redshift. The sample with smaller       has a smaller ratio of the splashback radius to the traditional halo boundary       than the subsample with larger       , indicative of different mass accretion rates for these subsamples. The same subsamples were recently used by Miyatake et al. to show that their large-scale clustering differs despite their similar weak lensing masses, demonstrating strong evidence for halo assembly bias. We expand on this result by presenting a 6.6 σ difference in the clustering amplitudes of these samples using cluster–photometric galaxy cross-correlations. This measurement is a clear indication that halo clustering depends on parameters other than halo mass. If       is related to the mass assembly history of halos, the measurement is a manifestation of the halo assembly bias. However, our measured splashback radii are smaller, while the strength of the assembly bias signal is stronger, than the predictions of collisionless Λ cold dark matter simulations. We show that dynamical friction, cluster mis-centering, or projection effects are not likely to be the sole source of these discrepancies. However, further investigations regarding unknown catastrophic weak lensing or cluster identification systematics are warranted. },

   abstract = {Similarity solutions have been found for secondary infall and accretion onto an initially overdense perturbation in an Einstein-de Sitter (\omega =1) universe. After the initial collapse of a positive density perturbation, bound shells continue to turn around and fall in, with the radius of the shell currently turning around increasing as t^ 8/9 and the mass within this radius increasing as t^2/3 . The secondary infall approaches a self-similar form, with the exact behavior depending on the kind of gas and on central boundary conditions. If there is a central black hole, it grows by accretion, with the density having the power-law form rho \propto r^ -1.5 near the center. If there is no central black hole, a rho \propto r^-2.25 density profile results, with infalling matter added to successively larger radii. Solutions are given here for collisional, collisionless, and mixed gases. The collisional component, if present, accretes through an outwardly propagating shock, with fluid elements coming to rest a finite distance from the center if the adiabatic exponent gamma>4/3; softer equations of state may lead to black hole formation. The collisionless gas passes through the center and crosses itself, leading to the formation of outwardly propagating caustics. Each infalling collisionless particle relaxes after several crossing times to a periodic orbit given by the particle’s own initial conditions, allowing galaxy and cluster halos formed by secondary infall to be dated. Since infall ceases when \omega << 1, a galaxy halo of mass 10^12 MO within 100 kpc (for H0 = 100 km s -1 Mpc-1 ) can form only if \omega0 > 0.29. The close relationship between clusters of galaxies and giant voids is discussed in light of the similarity solutions found here and those found previously for voids.},

   abstract = {We find that infalling dark matter halos (i.e., the progenitors of satellite halos) begin losing mass well outside the virial radius of their eventual host halos. The peak mass occurs at a range of clustercentric distances, with median and 68th percentile range of 1.8+2.3?1.0 Rvir,host for progenitors of z = 0 satellites. The peak circular velocity for infalling halos occurs at significantly larger distances (3.7 +3.3?2.2 Rvir,host at z = 0). This difference arises because different physical processes set peak circular velocity (typically, ∼1:5 and larger mergers which cause transient circular velocity spikes) and peak mass (typically, smooth accretion) for infalling halos.We find that infalling halos also stop having significant mergers well before they enter the virial radius of their eventual hosts. Mergers larger than a 1:40 ratio in halo mass end for infalling halos at similar clustercentric distances (∼1.9Rvir,host) as the end of overall mass accretion. However, mergers larger than 1:3 typically end for infalling halos at more than four virial radial away from their eventual hosts. This limits the ability of mergers to affect quenching and morphology changes in clusters. We also note that the transient spikes which set peak circular velocity may lead to issues with abundance matching on that parameter, including unphysical galaxy stellar mass growth profiles near clusters; we propose a simple observational test to check if a better halo proxy for galaxy stellar mass exists.},

Using a galaxy group/cluster catalogue from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, together with a cosmologicalN-body simulation, we examine the origin of this environmental quenching beyond the virial radius. Accounting for the clustering of groups/clusters, we show that central galaxies show enhanced SFR quenching out to 2.5 virial radii beyond groups/clusters, and we demonstrate that this extended environmental enhancement can be explained simply by 'ejected' satellite galaxies that orbit beyond their host halo's virial radius. We show that ejected satellites typically orbit for several Gyr beyond the virial radius before falling back in, and thus they compose up to 40 per cent of all central galaxies near groups/clusters. We show that a model in which ejected satellites experience the same SFR quenching as satellites within a host halo can explain essentially all environmental dependence of galaxy quenching. Furthermore, ejected satellites (continue to) lose significant halo mass, an effect that is potentially observable via gravitational lensing. The SFRs/colours and stellar-to-halo masses of ejected satellites highlight the importance of environmental history and present challenges to models of galaxy occupation that ignore such history. © 2014 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

   abstract = { The splashback radius R sp , the apocentric radius of particles on their first orbit after falling into a dark matter halo, has recently been suggested to be a physically motivated halo boundary that separates accreting from orbiting material. Using the Sparta code presented in Paper I, we analyze the orbits of billions of particles in cosmological simulations of structure formation and measure R sp for a large sample of halos that span a mass range from dwarf galaxy to massive cluster halos, reach redshift 8, and include WMAP , Planck , and self-similar cosmologies. We analyze the dependence of R sp / R 200m and M sp / M 200m on the mass accretion rate Γ, halo mass, redshift, and cosmology. The scatter in these relations varies between 0.02 and 0.1 dex. While we confirm the known trend that R sp / R 200m decreases with Γ, the relationships turn out to be more complex than previously thought, demonstrating that R sp is an independent definition of the halo boundary that cannot trivially be reconstructed from spherical overdensity definitions. We present fitting functions for R sp / R 200m and M sp / M 200m as a function of accretion rate, peak height, and redshift, achieving an accuracy of 5% or better everywhere in the parameter space explored. We discuss the physical meaning of the distribution of particle apocenters and show that the previously proposed definition of R sp as the radius of the steepest logarithmic density slope encloses roughly three-quarters of the apocenters. Finally, we conclude that no analytical model presented thus far can fully explain our results. },

   abstract = {We present a systematic study of the density profiles of ΛCDM halos, focusing on the outer regions, 0.1 < r/R vir < 9. We show that the median and mean profiles of halo samples of a given peak height exhibit significant deviations from the universal analytic profiles discussed previously in the literature, such as the Navarro-Frenk-White and Einasto profiles, at radii r ≳ 0.5R 200m. In particular, at these radii the logarithmic slope of the median density profiles of massive or rapidly accreting halos steepens more sharply than predicted. The steepest slope of the profiles occurs at r R 200m, and its absolute value increases with increasing peak height or mass accretion rate, reaching slopes of -4 and steeper. Importantly, we find that the outermost density profiles at r ≳ R 200m are remarkably self-similar when radii are rescaled by R 200m. This self-similarity indicates that radii defined with respect to the mean density are preferred for describing the structure and evolution of the outer profiles. However, the inner density profiles are most self-similar when radii are rescaled by R 200c. We propose a new fitting formula that describes the median and mean profiles of halo samples selected by their peak height or mass accretion rate with accuracy ≲ 10% at all radii, redshifts, and masses we studied, r ≲ 9R vir, 0 < z < 6, and M vir > 1.7 × 1010 h -1 M ⊙. We discuss observational signatures of the profile features described above and show that the steepening of the outer profile should be detectable in future weak-lensing analyses of massive clusters.

We estimate the amount of such pseudo-evolution of mass between z = 1 and 0 for halos identified in a large N-body simulation, and show that it accounts for almost the entire mass evolution of the majority of halos with M 200p̄ ≲ 1012h- M⊙ and can be a significant fraction of the apparent mass growth even for cluster-sized halos. We estimate the magnitude of the pseudo-evolution assuming that halo density profiles remain static in physical coordinates, and show that this simple model predicts the pseudo-evolution of halos identified in numerical simulations to good accuracy, albeit with significant scatter. We discuss the impact of pseudo-evolution on the evolution of the halo mass function and show that the non-evolution of the low-mass end of the halo mass function is the result of a fortuitous cancellation between pseudo-evolution and the absorption of small halos into larger hosts. We also show that the evolution of the low-mass end of the concentration-mass relation observed in simulations is almost entirely due to the pseudo-evolution of mass. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for the interpretation of the evolution of various scaling relations between the observable properties of galaxies and galaxy clusters and their halo masses. © 2013.

   abstract = {The boundaries of cold dark matter halos are commonly defined to enclose a density contrast Δ relative to a reference (mean or critical) density. We argue that a more physical halo boundary choice is the radius at which accreted matter reaches its first orbital apocenter after turnaround. This splashback radius, Rsp, manifests itself as a sharp density drop in the halo outskirts, at a location that depends upon the mass accretion rate. We present calibrations of Rsp and the enclosed mass, Msp, as a function of mass accretion rate and peak height. We find that Rsp is in the range ≈0.8-R200m for rapidly accreting halos and is ≈1.5-R200m for slowly accreting halos. Thus, halos and their environmental effects can extend well beyond the conventionally defined "virial" radius. We show that Msp and Rsp evolve relatively strongly compared to other commonly used definitions. In particular, Msp evolves significantly even for the smallest dwarf-sized halos at z = 0. We also contrast Msp with the mass enclosed within four scale radii of the halo density profile, M<4rs, which characterizes the inner halo. During the early stages of halo assembly, Msp and M<4rs evolve similarly, but in the late stages M<4rs stops increasing while Msp continues to grow significantly. This illustrates that halos at low z can have "quiet" interiors while continuing to accrete mass in their outskirts. We discuss potential observational estimates of the splashback radius and show that it may already have been detected in galaxy clusters.},

   abstract = {We study the properties of distinct dark matter haloes (i.e. those that are not subhaloes) that have a final virial mass M vir at z = 0 less than their peak mass (M peak) in the Bolshoi-Planck cosmological simulation. We identify two primary causes of halo mass-loss: relaxation after a major merger and tidal stripping by a massive neighbouring halo. Major mergers initially boost M vir and typically cause the final halo to become more prolate and less relaxed and to have higher spin and lower NFW concentration. As the halo relaxes, high-energy material from the recent merger gradually escapes beyond the virial radius, temporarily resulting in a net negative accretion rate that reduces the halo mass by 5-15 per cent on average. Haloes that experience a major merger around z = 0.4 typically reach a minimum mass near z = 0. Tidal stripping mainly occurs in dense regions, and it causes haloes to become less prolate and have lower spins and higher NFW concentrations. Tidally stripped haloes often lose a large fraction of their peak mass (>20 per cent) and most never recover (or even re-attain a positive accretion rate). Low-mass haloes can be strongly affected by both post-merger mass-loss and tidal stripping, while high-mass haloes are predominantly influenced by post-merger mass-loss and show few signs of significant tidal stripping.},

Here we take a new approach to a quantitative characterisation of the Perseus-Pisces supercluster using a statistically complete sample of X-ray luminous galaxy groups and clusters from our CLASSIX galaxy cluster redshift survey. We used a friends-of-friends technique to construct the supercluster membership. We also studied the structure of the Southern Great Wall, which merges with the Perseus-Pisces supercluster with a slightly increased friends-of-friends linking length. In this work we discuss the geometric structure of the superclusters, compare the X-ray luminosity distribution of the members with that of the surroundings, and provide an estimate of the supercluster mass. These results establish Perseus-Pisces as the largest superstructure in the Universe at redshifts <i>z<i/> ≤ 0.03. With the new data this supercluster extends through the zone of avoidance, which has also been indicated by some studies of the galaxy distribution by means of HI observations. We investigated whether the shapes of the member groups and clusters in X-rays are aligned with the major axis of the supercluster. We find no evidence for a pronounced alignment, except for the ellipticities of Perseus and AWM7, which are aligned with the separation vector of the two systems and weakly with the supercluster.},

   abstract = {Previous studies of the galaxy and galaxy cluster distribution in the local Universe found indications for a large extension of the Local Supercluster up to a radius of 190 h −1 70 Mpc. We are using our large and highly complete CLASSIX survey of X-ray luminous galaxy clusters detected in the ROSAT All Sky Survey to trace the matter distribution in the local Universe and to explore the size of the flattened local density structure associated with the Local Supercluster. The Local Supercluster is oriented almost perpendicular to the Galactic plane. Since Galactic extinction increases towards the Galactic plane, objects are on average more easily visible perpendicular to the plane than close to it, also producing an apparent concentration of objects along the Local Supercluster. We can correct for this bias by a careful treatment of the survey selection function. We find a significant overdensity of clusters in a flattened structure along the Supergalactic plane with a thickness of about 50 Mpc and an extent of about 100 Mpc radius. Structures at a distance larger than 100 Mpc are not correlated to the Local Supercluster any more. The matter density contrast of the local superstructure to the surroundings is about a factor of 1.3−2.3. Within the Supergalactic plane the matter is concentrated mostly in two superclusters, the Perseus-Pices Chain and Hydra-Centaurus supercluster. We have shown in our earlier work that the local Universe in a region with a radius of 100−170 Mpc has a lower density than the cosmic mean. For this reason, the Local Supercluster is not overdense with respect to the cosmic mean density. Therefore this local superstructure will not collapse as a whole in the future, but rather fragment.},

   abstract = {Context. Large scale agglomerations of galaxy clusters are the most massive structures in the universe. To what degree they are actually bound against an accelerating expansion of the background cosmology is of significant cosmological as well as astrophysical interest. In this study, we introduce a cross matched set of superclusters from the SLOW constrained simulations of the local (z<0.05) universe. These simulations combine a central region constrained by local velocity field data and realistic baryonic physics models within a 500 Mpc/h Box to reproduce the locally observed large scale structure in detail. Aims. Identifying the local superclusters provides estimates on the efficacy of the constraints in reproducing the local large-scale structure accurately. The simulated counterparts can help identifying possible future observational targets containing interesting features such as bridges between pre-merging and merging galaxy clusters and collapsing filaments and provide comparisons for current observations. By numerically determining the collapse volumes for the simulated counterparts we further elucidate the dynamics of cluster-cluster interactions in those regions. Methods. Starting from observational catalogs of local superclusters and the most massive clusters from the SLOW simulations already identified in previous works, we search for simulated counterparts of supercluster members of six regions. We evaluate the significance of these detections by comparing the observed geometries to supercluster regions in random simulations. We then run an N-body version of the SLOW initial conditions into the far future and determine which of the member clusters are gravitationally bound to the host superclusters. Furthermore we compute masses and density contrasts for the collapse regions. Results. We demonstrate the SLOW constrained simulation of the local universe to accurately reproduce local supercluster regions not only in mass of their members but also in the individual clusters three-dimensional geometrical arrangement relative to each other. We furthermore find the bound regions of the local superclusters consistent in both size and density contrast with previous theoretical studies. This will allow to connect future numerical zoom-in studies of the clusters to the large scale environments and specifically the supercluster environments these local galaxy clusters evolve in. The zoom-ins will focus on ICM properties, turbulence and non-thermal emission and build on the existing work concerned with the environments of local galaxy clusters.},

   abstract = {We present the first proper-motion (PM) measurements for the galaxy M31. We obtained new V-band imaging data with the Hubble Space Telescope ACS/WFC and the WFC3/UVIS instruments of three fields: a spheroid field near the minor axis, an outer disk field along the major axis, and a field on the Giant Southern Stream. The data provide five to seven year time baselines with respect to pre-existing deep first-epoch observations of the same fields. We measure the positions of thousands of M31 stars and hundreds of compact background galaxies in each field. High accuracy and robustness is achieved by building and fitting a unique template for each individual object. The average PM for each field is obtained from the average motion of the M31 stars between the epochs with respect to the background galaxies. For the three fields, the observed PMs (μW, μN) are, in units of mas yr-1, (- 0.0458, -0.0376) ± (0.0165, 0.0154), (- 0.0533, -0.0104) ± (0.0246, 0.0244), and (- 0.0179, -0.0357) ± (0.0278, 0.0272), respectively. The ability to average over large numbers of objects and over the three fields yields a final displacement accuracy of a few thousandths of a pixel, corresponding to only 12 μas yr-1. This is comparable to what has been achieved for other Local Group galaxies using Very Long Baseline Array observations of water masers. Potential systematic errors are controlled by an analysis strategy that corrects for detector charge transfer inefficiency, spatially and time-dependent geometric distortion, and point-spread function variations. The robustness of the PM measurements and uncertainties are supported by the fact that data from different instruments, taken at different times and with different telescope orientations, as well as measurements of different fields, all yield statistically consistent results. Papers II and III of this series explore the implications of the new measurements for our understanding of the history, future, and mass of the Local Group. © 2012. The American Astronomical Society.

   abstract = {We calculate the maximum fraction of matter which is able to condense out of the expanding background universe, for any universe which will expand forever. We use a simple spherical model for the growth of density fluctuations in the universe. This model includes open, matter-dominated universe and universes in which there is an uniform background component (e.g. the cosmological constant or "quintessence"). In these background universes, Omega eventually drops significantly below unity. When this happens, gravitational instability is suppressed and, with it, so is the growth of the collapsed fraction. We identify a limitation of the Press-Schechter (PS) approximation. In this approximation, the mass function determined from the predicted collapse of overdense regions is multiplied by a correction factor of 2, assuming that each bound fluctuation will accrete an equal share of mass from nearby underdense regions. Our model determines the actual value of the correction factor. We show that, while the factor of 2 adopted by the PS approximation is correct for an Einstein-de Sitter universe, it is not correct when the freeze-out of fluctuation growth inherent in the more general class of background universes described above occurs. When freeze-out occurs, the correction factor reduces to unity and the PS approximation must overestimate the collapsed fraction. We apply our model to open CDM and flat Lambda-CDM models. For H0=70 and Omega0=0.3, these models yield asymptotic collapsed fractions of 0.0361 and 0.0562, respectively, on the galaxy cluster mass-scale, only 55% of the values determined by the PS approximation. These results have implications for the use of the latter approximation to compare the observed space density of X-ray clusters today with that predicted by cosmological models.},

   abstract = {Dark-matter-dominated cluster-scale halos act as an important cosmological probe and provide a key testing ground for structure formation theory. Focusing on their mass profiles, we have carried out (gravity-only) simulations of the concordance ΛCDM cosmology, covering a mass range of 2 × 10 12 to 2 × 1015 h -1 M⊙ and a redshift range of z = 0-2, while satisfying the associated requirements of resolution and statistical control. When fitting to the Navarro-Frenk-White profile, our concentration-mass (c-M) relation differs in normalization and shape in comparison to previous studies that have limited statistics in the upper end of the mass range. We show that the flattening of the c-M relation with redshift is naturally expressed if c is viewed as a function of the peak height parameter, ν. Unlike the c-M relation, the slope of the c-ν relation is effectively constant over the redshift range z = 0-2, while the amplitude varies by ∼30% for massive clusters. This relation is, however, not universal: using a simulation suite covering the allowed wCDM parameter space, we show that the c-ν relation varies by about ±20% as cosmological parameters are varied. At fixed mass, the c(M) distribution is well fit by a Gaussian with σc /〈c〉 ≃ 1/3, independent of the radius at which the concentration is defined, the halo dynamical state, and the underlying cosmology. We compare the ΛCDM predictions with observations of halo concentrations from strong lensing, weak lensing, galaxy kinematics, and X-ray data, finding good agreement for massive clusters (Mvir > 4 × 1014 h -1 M ⊙), but with some disagreements at lower masses. Because of uncertainty in observational systematics and modeling of baryonic physics, the significance of these discrepancies remains unclear. © 2013. The American Astronomical Society.

We show that the number density of the Galaxy's outer satellites can be modelled by a power-law function. Assuming that the total distribution of matter (visible and dark) can be modelled in a similar way, we construct a self-consistent, self-similar model of the outer Galaxy. From this we derive a probability distribution for two quantities; the radial velocity and galactocentric distance. Considering the velocity distribution in the outer Galaxy to be isotropic, this probability distribution contains two free parameters; the Galactic mass and the power-law index for the total matter density profile which we subsequently determine by way of maximum likelihood estimation. We obtain a mass of around 1.3 x 1012 MQ out to a distance of 230 kpc from the Galactic Centre with a corresponding power-law index of 2.4. Confidence regions are derived for these estimates from which a iow-mass' galaxy, (i.e. M<6 x 1011 M0), can be ruled out with 98 per cent confidence. Our result suggests a high mass for the Milky Way out to a large distance and relies on the inclusion of the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Leo I in the sample. The most recent velocity and distance data we could find for all globular clusters and dwarf spheroidal galaxies, beyond R0, including the newly discovered dwarf spheroidal galaxy in Sextans were used in the analysis. We also briefly discuss a self-similar galactic model where the velocity distribution is anisotropic.},

   abstract = {The cold dark matter halo mass function is much steeper than the galaxy stellar mass function on galactic and subgalactic scales. This difference is usually reconciled by assuming that the galaxy formation efficiency drops sharply with decreasing halomass, so that virtually no dwarf galaxies form in haloes less massive than ~1010M⊙. In turn, this implies that, at any given radius, the dark mass enclosed by a galaxy must exceed a certain minimum. We use rotation curves of dwarf galaxies compiled from the literature to explore whether their enclosed mass is consistent with these constraints. We find that almost one-half of the dwarfs in our sample with stellar mass in the range of 106 < Mgal/M⊙ < 107 are at odds with this restriction: either they live in haloes with masses substantially below 1010M⊙ or there is a mechanism capable of reducing the dark mass enclosed by some of the faintest dwarfs. Neither possibility is easily accommodated within the standard Λ cold dark matter scenario. Extending galaxy formation to haloes well below 1010M⊙ would lead to large numbers of dwarf galaxies in excess of current estimates; at the same time, the extremely low stellar mass of the systems involved makes it unlikely that baryonic effects can reduce their dark matter content. Resolving this challenge seems to require new insights into dwarf galaxy formation, or perhaps a radical revision of the prevailing paradigm.},

We find that all such profiles have the same shape, independent of halo mass, of initial density fluctuation spectrum, and of the values of the cosmological parameters. Spherically averaged equilibrium profiles are well fit over two decades in radius by a simple formula originally proposed to describe the structure of galaxy clusters in a cold dark matter universe. In any particular cosmology the two scale parameters of the fit, the halo mass and its characteristic density, are strongly correlated. Low-mass halos are significantly denser than more massive systems, a correlation which reflects the higher collapse redshift of small halos. The characteristic density of an equilibrium halo is proportional to the density of the universe at the time it was assembled. A suitable definition of this assembly time allows the same proportionality constant to be used for all the cosmologies that we have tested. We compare our results to previous work on halo density profiles and show that there is good agreement. We also provide a step-by-step analytic procedure, based on the Press-Schechter formalism, which allows accurate equilibrium profiles to be calculated as a function of mass in any hierarchical model.},

   abstract = {We use N-body simulations to investigate the structure of dark halos in the standard Cold Dark Matter cosmogony. Halos are excised from simulations of cosmologically representative regions and are resimulated individually at high resolution. We study objects with masses ranging from those of dwarf galaxy halos to those of rich galaxy clusters. The spherically averaged density profiles of all our halos can be fit over two decades in radius by scaling a simple ``universal'' profile. The characteristic overdensity of a halo, or equivalently its concentration, correlates strongly with halo mass in a way which reflects the mass dependence of the epoch of halo formation. Halo profiles are approximately isothermal over a large range in radii, but are significantly shallower than $r^\{-2\}$ near the center and steeper than $r^\{-2\}$ near the virial radius. Matching the observed rotation curves of disk galaxies requires disk mass-to-light ratios to increase systematically with luminosity. Further, it suggests that the halos of bright galaxies depend only weakly on galaxy luminosity and have circular velocities significantly lower than the disk rotation speed. This may explain why luminosity and dynamics are uncorrelated in observed samples of binary galaxies and of satellite/spiral systems. For galaxy clusters, our halo models are consistent both with the presence of giant arcs and with the observed structure of the intracluster medium, and they suggest a simple explanation for the disparate estimates of cluster core radii found by previous authors. Our results also highlight two shortcomings of the CDM model. CDM halos are too concentrated to be consistent with the halo parameters inferred for dwarf irregulars, and the predicted abundance of galaxy halos is larger than the observed abundance of galaxies.},

   abstract = {Constraints on dark matter halo masses from weak gravitational lensing can be improved significantly by using additional information about the morphology of their density distribution, leading to tighter cosmological constraints derived from the halo mass function. This work is the first of two in which we investigate the accuracy of halo morphology and mass measurements in 2D and 3D. To this end, we determine several halo physical properties in the MICE-Grand Challenge dark matter only simulation. We present a public catalogue of these properties that includes density profiles and shape parameters measured in 2D and 3D, the halo centre at the peak of the 3D density distribution as well as the gravitational and kinetic energies and angular momentum vectors. The density profiles are computed using spherical and ellipsoidal radial bins, taking into account the halo shapes. We also provide halo concentrations and masses derived from fits to 2D and 3D density profiles using NFW and Einasto models for halos with more than $1000$ particles ($\gtrsim 3 \times 10^\{13\} h^\{-1\} M_\{\odot\}$). We find that the Einasto model provides better fits compared to NFW, regardless of the halo relaxation state and shape. The mass and concentration parameters of the 3D density profiles derived from fits to the 2D profiles are in general biased. Similar biases are obtained when constraining mass and concentrations using a weak-lensing stacking analysis. We show that these biases depend on the radial range and density profile model adopted in the fitting procedure, but not on the halo shape.},

The generation of a hot intracluster medium is discussed and its relation to the observed absence of normal spirals in rich clusters investigated. The inference made earlier by Gott and Gunn that the observed X-ray luminosity of Coma puts severe constraints on the deceleration parameter #o is further elucidated.

   abstract = {We present a comprehensive set of convergence tests which explore the role of various numerical parameters on the equilibrium structure of a simulated dark matter halo. We report on results obtained with two independent, state-of-the-art, multi-stepping, parallel N-body codes: PKDGRAV and GADGET. We find that convergent mass profiles can be obtained for suitable choices of the gravitational softening, time-step, force accuracy, initial redshift, and particle number. For softenings chosen so that particle discreteness effects are negligible, convergence in the circular velocity is obtained at radii where the following conditions are satisfied: (i) the time-step is much shorter than the local orbital time-scale; (ii) accelerations do not exceed a characteristic acceleration imprinted by the gravitational softening; and (iii) enough particles are enclosed so that the collisional relaxation time-scale is longer than the age of the Universe. Convergence also requires sufficiently high initial redshift and accurate force computations. Poor spatial, time, or force resolution leads generally to systems with artificially low central density, but may also result in the formation of artificially dense central cusps. We have explored several adaptive time-stepping choices and we have obtained the best results when individual time-steps are chosen according to the local acceleration and the gravitational softening (Δti ∝ (∈/ ai)1/2), although further experimentation may yield better and more efficient criteria. The most stringent requirement for convergence is typically that imposed on the particle number by the collisional relaxation criterion. This implies that, in order to estimate accurate circular velocities at radii where the density contrast may reach ∼106, the region must enclose of the order of 3000 particles (or more than a few times 106 within the virial radius). Applying these criteria to a galaxy-sized ACDM halo, we find that the spherically averaged density profile becomes progressively shallower from the virial radius inwards, reaching a logarithmic slope shallower than -1.2 at the innermost resolved point, ∼0.005r200, with little evidence for convergence to a power-law behaviour in the inner regions.},

   abstract = {Cosmological N-body simulations have been a major tool of theorists for decades, yet many of the numerical issues that these simulations face are still unexplored. This paper measures numerical biases in these large, dark matter-only simulations that affect the properties of their dark matter haloes. We compare many simulation suites in order to provide several tools for simulators and analysts which help mitigate these biases. We summarize our comparisons with practical 'convergence limits' that can be applied to a wide range of halo properties, including halo properties which are traditionally overlooked by the testing literature. We also find that the halo properties predicted by different simulations can diverge from one another at unexpectedly high resolutions. We demonstrate that many halo properties depend strongly on force softening scale and that this dependence leads to much of the measured divergence between simulations. We offer an empirical model to estimate the impact of such effects on the rotation curves of a halo population. This model can serve as a template for future empirical models of the biases in other halo properties.},

   abstract = {We present the evolution of dark matter halos in six large cosmological N-body simulations, called the ν2GC (New Numerical Galaxy Catalog) simulations on the basis of the ΛCDM cosmology consistent with observational results obtained with the Planck satellite. The largest simulation consists of 81923 (550 billion) dark matter particles in a box of 1.12 h-1 Gpc (a mass resolution of 2.20 × 108 h-1 M). Among simulations utilizing boxes larger than 1 h-1 Gpc, our simulation yields the highest resolution simulation that has ever been achieved. A ν2GC simulation with the smallest box consists of eight billion particles in a box of 70 h-1 Mpc (a mass resolution of 3.44 × 106 h-1 M). These simulations can follow the evolution of halos over masses of eight orders of magnitude, from small dwarf galaxies to massive clusters. Using the unprecedentedly high resolution and powerful statistics of the ν2GC simulations, we provide statistical results of the halo mass function, mass accretion rate, formation redshift, and merger statistics, and present accurate-fitting functions for the Planck cosmology. By combining the ν2GC simulations with our new semianalytic galaxy formation model, we are able to prepare mock catalogs of galaxies and active galactic nuclei, which will be publicly available in the near future.},

Unlike many previous Gordon-Bell prize winners that used the tree algorithm for astrophysical N-body simulations, we used the hybrid TreePM method, for similar level of accuracy in which the short-range force is calculated by the tree algorithm, and the long-range force is solved by the particle-mesh algorithm. We developed a highly-tuned gravity kernel for short-range forces, and a novel communication algorithm for long-range forces. The average performance on 24576 and 82944 nodes of K computer are 1.53 and 4.45 Pflops, which correspond to 49% and 42% of the peak speed.},

   abstract = {We present a new high-resolution N-body algorithm for cosmological simulations. The algorithm employs a traditional particle-mesh technique on a cubic grid and successive multilevel relaxations on the finer meshes, introduced recursively in a fully adaptive manner in the regions where the density exceeds a predefined threshold. The mesh is generated to effectively match an arbitrary geometry of the underlying density field -- a property particularly important for cosmological simulations. In a simulation the mesh structure is not created at every time step but is properly adjusted to the evolving particle distribution. The algorithm is fast and effectively parallel. We present a detailed description of the methodology, implementation, and tests of the code. We further use the code to study the structure of dark matter halos in high-resolution (2/h kpc) simulations of standard CDM (Omega=1, h=0.5, sigma_8=0.63) and LCDM (Omega_Lambda=1-Omega_0=0.7, h=0.7, sigma_8=1.0) models. We find that halo density profiles in both CDM and LCDM models are well fitted by the analytical model presented recently by Navarro et al., which predicts a singular [$\rho(r)\propto r^\{-1\}$] behavior of the halo density profiles at small radii. We therefore conclude that halos formed in the $\Lambda$CDM model have structure similar to CDM halos and thus cannot explain the dynamics of the central parts of dwarf spiral galaxies, as inferred from the galaxies' rotation curves.},

   abstract = { We build a field-level emulator for cosmic structure formation that is accurate in the nonlinear regime. Our emulator consists of two convolutional neural networks trained to output the nonlinear displacements and velocities of N -body simulation particles based on their linear inputs. Cosmology dependence is encoded in the form of style parameters at each layer of the neural network, enabling the emulator to effectively interpolate the outcomes of structure formation between different flat Lambda cold dark matter cosmologies over a wide range of background matter densities. The neural network architecture makes the model differentiable by construction, providing a powerful tool for fast field-level inference. We test the accuracy of our method by considering several summary statistics, including the density power spectrum with and without redshift space distortions, the displacement power spectrum, the momentum power spectrum, the density bispectrum, halo abundances, and halo profiles with and without redshift space distortions. We compare these statistics from our emulator with the full N -body results, the COmoving Lagrangian Acceleration (COLA) method, and a fiducial neural network with no cosmological dependence. We find that our emulator gives accurate results down to scales of k ∼ 1 Mpc −1 h , representing a considerable improvement over both COLA and the fiducial neural network. We also demonstrate that our emulator generalizes well to initial conditions containing primordial non-Gaussianity without the need for any additional style parameters or retraining. },

   abstract = {We use 26×106 galaxies from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 1 shape catalogs over 1321 deg2 of the sky to produce the most significant measurement of cosmic shear in a galaxy survey to date. We constrain cosmological parameters in both the flat ΛCDM and the wCDM models, while also varying the neutrino mass density. These results are shown to be robust using two independent shape catalogs, two independent photo-z calibration methods, and two independent analysis pipelines in a blind analysis. We find a 3.5% fractional uncertainty on σ8(Ωm/0.3)0.5=0.782-0.027+0.027 at 68% C.L., which is a factor of 2.5 improvement over the fractional constraining power of our DES Science Verification results. In wCDM, we find a 4.8% fractional uncertainty on σ8(Ωm/0.3)0.5=0.777-0.038+0.036 and a dark energy equation-of-state w=-0.95-0.39+0.33. We find results that are consistent with previous cosmic shear constraints in σ8 - Ωm, and we see no evidence for disagreement of our weak lensing data with data from the cosmic microwave background. Finally, we find no evidence preferring a wCDM model allowing w≠-1. We expect further significant improvements with subsequent years of DES data, which will more than triple the sky coverage of our shape catalogs and double the effective integrated exposure time per galaxy.},

We develop a new lower noise method for performing this inference from the latest Ly α forest 1D power spectrum data. We also include cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization power spectra and lensing reconstruction data, the cosmic shear two-point correlation function, and the clustering of luminous red galaxies. We provide a Dockerized Jupyter notebook housing the fairly complex dependences for producing the plot of these data, with the hope that groups in the future can help add to it. Overall, we find qualitative agreement between the independent measurements considered here and the standard CDM cosmological model fit to the Planck data.},

The Q uijote simulations have been designed for two main purposes: (1) to quantify the information content on cosmological observables and (2) to provide enough data to train machine-learning algorithms. In this paper, we describe the simulations and show a few of their applications. We also release the petabyte of data generated, comprising hundreds of thousands of simulation snapshots at multiple redshifts; halo and void catalogs; and millions of summary statistics, such as power spectra, bispectra, correlation functions, marked power spectra, and estimated probability density functions. },

This activity is computationally expensive, since a typical project requires from 104 to 105 Boltzmann code executions. The newly released code CLASS (Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System) incorporates improved approximation schemes leading to a simultaneous gain in speed and precision. We describe here the three approximations used by CLASS for basic ΛCDM models, namely: a baryon-photon tight-coupling approximation which can be set to first order, second order or to a compromise between the two; an ultra-relativistic fluid approximation which had not been implemented in public distributions before; and finally a radiation streaming approximation taking reionisation into account. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA.},

   abstract = {The standard Λ Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM) cosmological model provides a good description of a wide range of astrophysical and cosmological data. However, there are a few big open questions that make the standard model look like an approximation to a more realistic scenario yet to be found. In this paper, we list a few important goals that need to be addressed in the next decade, taking into account the current discordances between the different cosmological probes, such as the disagreement in the value of the Hubble constant H0, the σ8–S8 tension, and other less statistically significant anomalies. While these discordances can still be in part the result of systematic errors, their persistence after several years of accurate analysis strongly hints at cracks in the standard cosmological scenario and the necessity for new physics or generalisations beyond the standard model. In this paper, we focus on the 5.0σ tension between the Planck CMB estimate of the Hubble constant H0 and the SH0ES collaboration measurements. After showing the H0 evaluations made from different teams using different methods and geometric calibrations, we list a few interesting new physics models that could alleviate this tension and discuss how the next decade's experiments will be crucial. Moreover, we focus on the tension of the Planck CMB data with weak lensing measurements and redshift surveys, about the value of the matter energy density Ωm, and the amplitude or rate of the growth of structure (σ8,fσ8). We list a few interesting models proposed for alleviating this tension, and we discuss the importance of trying to fit a full array of data with a single model and not just one parameter at a time. Additionally, we present a wide range of other less discussed anomalies at a statistical significance level lower than the H0–S8 tensions which may also constitute hints towards new physics, and we discuss possible generic theoretical approaches that can collectively explain the non-standard nature of these signals. Finally, we give an overview of upgraded experiments and next-generation space missions and facilities on Earth that will be of crucial importance to address all these open questions.},

We detail improvements to the PS1 SN photometry, astrometry, and calibration that reduce the systematic uncertainties in the PS1 SN Ia distances. We combine the subset of       PS1 SNe Ia (0.03 <  z  < 0.68) with useful distance estimates of SNe Ia from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), SNLS, and various low- z and Hubble Space Telescope samples to form the largest combined sample of SNe Ia, consisting of a total of       SNe Ia in the range of 0.01 <  z  < 2.3, which we call the “Pantheon Sample.” When combining Planck 2015 cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements with the Pantheon SN sample, we find      and      for the w CDM model. When the SN and CMB constraints are combined with constraints from BAO and local H 0 measurements, the analysis yields the most precise measurement of dark energy to date:      and      for the      CDM model. Tension with a cosmological constant previously seen in an analysis of PS1 and low- z SNe has diminished after an increase of 2× in the statistics of the PS1 sample, improved calibration and photometry, and stricter light-curve quality cuts. We find that the systematic uncertainties in our measurements of dark energy are almost as large as the statistical uncertainties, primarily due to limitations of modeling the low-redshift sample. This must be addressed for future progress in using SNe Ia to measure dark energy. },

The Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment 2 (APOGEE-2) is observing hundreds of thousands of Milky Way stars at high resolution and high signal-to-noise ratios in the near-infrared. The Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey is obtaining spatially resolved spectroscopy for thousands of nearby galaxies (median       ). The extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) is mapping the galaxy, quasar, and neutral gas distributions between       and 3.5 to constrain cosmology using baryon acoustic oscillations, redshift space distortions, and the shape of the power spectrum. Within eBOSS, we are conducting two major subprograms: the SPectroscopic IDentification of eROSITA Sources (SPIDERS), investigating X-ray AGNs and galaxies in X-ray clusters, and the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey (TDSS), obtaining spectra of variable sources. All programs use the 2.5 m Sloan Foundation Telescope at the Apache Point Observatory; observations there began in Summer 2014. APOGEE-2 also operates a second near-infrared spectrograph at the 2.5 m du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, with observations beginning in early 2017. Observations at both facilities are scheduled to continue through 2020. In keeping with previous SDSS policy, SDSS-IV provides regularly scheduled public data releases; the first one, Data Release 13, was made available in 2016 July. },

   abstract = {We introduce the Virgo Consortium's FLAMINGO suite of hydrodynamical simulations for cosmology and galaxy cluster physics. To ensure the simulations are sufficiently realistic for studies of large-scale structure, the subgrid prescriptions for stellar and AGN feedback are calibrated to the observed low-redshift galaxy stellar mass function and cluster gas fractions. The calibration is performed using machine learning, separately for each of FLAMINGO's three resolutions. This approach enables specification of the model by the observables to which they are calibrated. The calibration accounts for a number of potential observational biases and for random errors in the observed stellar masses. The two most demanding simulations have box sizes of 1.0 and 2.8 Gpc on a side and baryonic particle masses of 1 × 108 and, respectively. For the latter resolution, the suite includes 12 model variations in a 1 Gpc box. There are 8 variations at fixed cosmology, including shifts in the stellar mass function and/or the cluster gas fractions to which we calibrate, and two alternative implementations of AGN feedback (thermal or jets). The remaining 4 variations use the unmodified calibration data but different cosmologies, including different neutrino masses. The 2.8 Gpc simulation follows 3 × 1011 particles, making it the largest ever hydrodynamical simulation run to z = 0. Light-cone output is produced on-The-fly for up to 8 different observers. We investigate numerical convergence, show that the simulations reproduce the calibration data, and compare with a number of galaxy, cluster, and large-scale structure observations, finding very good agreement with the data for converged predictions. Finally, by comparing hydrodynamical and 'dark-matter-only' simulations, we confirm that baryonic effects can suppress the halo mass function and the matter power spectrum by up to ≈20 per cent.},

Here, we introduce the millenniumTNG (MTNG) project which combines the hydrodynamical galaxy formation model of illustrisTNG with the large volume of the millennium simulation. Our largest hydrodynamic simulation, covering, is complemented by a suite of dark-matter-only simulations with up to 43203 dark matter particles (a mass resolution of) using the fixed-and-paired technique to reduce large-scale cosmic variance. The hydro simulation adds 43203 gas cells, achieving a baryonic mass resolution of. High time-resolution merger trees and direct light-cone outputs facilitate the construction of a new generation of semi-analytic galaxy formation models that can be calibrated against both the hydro simulation and observation, and then applied to even larger volumes - MTNG includes a flagship simulation with 1.1 trillion dark matter particles and massive neutrinos in a volume of. In this introductory analysis we carry out convergence tests on basic measures of non-linear clustering such as the matter power spectrum, the halo mass function and halo clustering, and we compare simulation predictions to those from current cosmological emulators. We also use our simulations to study matter and halo statistics, such as halo bias and clustering at the baryonic acoustic oscillation scale. Finally we measure the impact of baryonic physics on the matter and halo distributions.},

   abstract = {The Hubble constant, H0, or its dimensionless equivalent, “little h”, is a fundamental cosmological property that is now known to an accuracy better than a few per cent. Despite its cosmological nature, little h commonly appears in the measured properties of individual galaxies. This can pose unique challenges for users of such data, particularly with survey data. In this paper we show how little h arises in the measurement of galaxies, how to compare like-properties from different datasets that have assumed different little h cosmologies, and how to fairly compare theoretical data with observed data, where little h can manifest in vastly different ways. This last point is particularly important when observations are used to calibrate galaxy formation models, as calibrating with the wrong (or no) little h can lead to disastrous results when the model is later converted to the correct h cosmology. We argue that in this modern age little h is an anachronism, being one of least uncertain parameters in astrophysics, and we propose that observers and theorists instead treat this uncertainty like any other. We conclude with a ‘cheat sheet’ of nine points that should be followed when dealing with little h in data analysis.},

Recently, there has been increasing interest in whether or not the intermediate representations offered by these modules may be used to explain the reasoning for a model's prediction, and consequently reach insights regarding the model's decision-making process. A recent paper claims that 'Attention is not Explanation' (Jain and Wallace, 2019). We challenge many of the assumptions underlying this work, arguing that such a claim depends on one's definition of explanation, and that testing it needs to take into account all elements of the model. We propose four alternative tests to determine when/whether attention can be used as explanation: a simple uniform-weights baseline; a variance calibration based on multiple random seed runs; a diagnostic framework using frozen weights from pretrained models; and an end-to-end adversarial attention training protocol. Each allows for meaningful interpretation of attention mechanisms in RNN models. We show that even when reliable adversarial distributions can be found, they don't perform well on the simple diagnostic, indicating that prior work does not disprove the usefulness of attention mechanisms for explainability.},

All Cepheids in these anchors and SN Ia hosts were measured with the same instrument (WFC3) and filters ( F555W , F814W , F160W ) to negate zero-point errors. We present multiple verifications of Cepheid photometry and six tests of background determinations that show Cepheid measurements are accurate in the presence of crowded backgrounds. The SNe Ia in these hosts calibrate the magnitude–redshift relation from the revised Pantheon+ compilation, accounting here for covariance between all SN data and with host properties and SN surveys matched throughout to negate systematics.

   abstract = {We present the power spectrum of the reconstructed halo density field derived from a sample of luminous red galaxies (LRGs) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Seventh Data Release (DR7). The halo power spectrum has a direct connection to the underlying dark matter power for k ≤ 0.2 h Mpc-1, well into the quasi-linear regime. This enables us to use a factor of ~8 more modes in the cosmological analysis than an analysis with kmax = 0.1 h Mpc-1,aswas adopted in the SDSS team analysis of the DR4 LRG sample. The observed halo power spectrum for 0.02 <k<0.2 h Mpc-1 is well fitted by our model: χ2 = 39.6 for 40 degrees of freedom for the best-fitting Δ cold dark matter (ΔCDM) model. We find Ωmh2(ns/0.96)1.2 = 0.141+0.010-0.012 for a power-law primordial power spectrum with spectral index ns and Ωbh2 = 0.022 65 fixed, consistent with cosmic microwave background measurements. The halo power spectrum also constrains the ratio of the comoving sound horizon at the baryon-drag epoch to an effective distance to z = 0.35: rs/DV(0.35) = 0.1097+0.0039-0.0042. Combining the halo power spectrum measurement with the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) 5 year results, for the flat ΔCDM model we find Ωm = 0.289 ± 0.019 and H0 = 69.4 ± 1.6 km s-1 Mpc-1. Allowing ∑ for massive neutrinos in ΔCDM, we find σmν < 0.62 eV at the 95 per cent confidence level.

   abstract = {Recently it has become fashionable to assume that galaxies and clusters formed from scale-invariant adiabatic perturbations. This idea is supported by Grand Unified Theories, which predict that primordial irregularities in the ratio of baryons to photons would not survive the epoch of baryosynthesis, and by inflationary models for the origin of perturbations. However, if axions (or some other pseudo-Goldstone bosons with similar properties) dominate the mass density of the Universe, scale-invariant isocurvature perturbations could have played an important role in galaxy formation. We investigate this possibility in detail, with special emphasis on the constraints set by observations of the microwave background radiation. Isocurvature perturbations lead to a new source of anisotropy on large angular scales (#>1°) which exceeds the familiar Sachs-Wolfe effect. If galaxies are unbiased tracers of the mass distribution, scale-invariant isocurvature perturbations in Q=1 models with /z 0 <l [where /i 0 =// 0 /(100 km s-1 Mpc-1)] can be excluded by anisotropy limits on angular scales 0>6°. Models with /i 0 <0.75 are unacceptable even if the amplitude of the galaxy correlation function is four times that of the mass distribution (as predicted in some models of 'biased' galaxy formation). Anisotropy limits on arcminute scales are violated by models with Q/z 0 <0.2.},

We use a complete, volume-limited subsample of 35 X-ray-luminous clusters of galaxies at 0.15<z<0.3 to constrain the abundance of very massive (M>~1015 h-1 Msolar) clusters. From this, we constrain σ8(Ωm/0.3)0.37=0.67+0.04-0.05 (68% confidence limits), agreeing well with constraints from the 3 year WMAP CMB measurements and estimates of cluster abundances based on X-ray observations, but somewhat lower than constraints from ``cosmic shear'' weak-lensing measurements in random fields.

On the other hand, various modifications of the method of steepest-descent have been used. Both methods not infrequently run aground, the Taylor series method because of divergence of the successive iterates, the steepest-descent (or gradient) methods because of agonizingly slow convergence after the first few iterations. In this paper a maximum neighborhood method is developed which, in effect, performs an optimum interpolation between the Taylor series method and the gradient method, the interpolation being based upon the maximum neighborhood in which the truncated Taylor series gives an adequate representation of the nonlinear model.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

In contrast to several previous approaches which apply the Press--Schechter mass function in a straightforward manner, our method can explicitly take into account the temperature and luminosity evolution of clusters. In order to make quantitative predictions in a specific cosmological context, we adopt cold dark matter (CDM) universes. Assuming the baryon density parameter $\Omega_\{\rm B\}=0.0125 h^\{-2\}$ ($h$ is the Hubble constant in units of 100 km$\cdot$sec$^\{-1\}\cdot$Mpc$^\{-1\}$) and the \{\it COBE\} normalization of matter fluctuations, temperature and luminosity functions of X-ray clusters depend sensitively on the density parameter $\Omega_0$. Allowing for several uncertainties in observational data as well as in our simplified assumptions, we conclude that $\Omega_0 \sim 0.2-0.5$ and $h\sim 0.7$ CDM models with/without the cosmological constant reproduce simultaneously the observed temperature and luminosity functions of X-ray clusters at redshift $z\sim0$.},

   abstract = {We use an array of high-resolution N-body simulations to determine the mass function of dark matter haloes at redshifts 10-30. We develop a new method for compensating for the effects of finite simulation volume that allows us to find an approximation to the true 'global' mass function. By simulating a wide range of volumes at different mass resolution, we calculate the abundance of haloes of mass 10 5−12 h −1 M ⊙. This enables us to predict accurately the abundance of the haloes that host the sources that reionize the Universe. In particular, we focus on the small mass haloes (10 5.5−6 h −1 M ⊙) likely to harbour Population III stars where gas cools by molecular hydrogen emission, early galaxies in which baryons cool by atomic hydrogen emission at a virial temperature of ∼10 4 K(∼10 7.5−8 h −1 M ⊙), and massive galaxies that may be observable at redshift ∼10. When we combine our data with simulations that include high-mass haloes at low redshift, we find that the best fit to the halo mass function depends not only on the linear overdensity, as is commonly assumed in analytic models, but also on the slope of the linear power spectrum at the scale of the halo mass. The Press-Schechter model gives a poor fit to the halo mass function in the simulations at all epochs; the Sheth-Tormen model gives a better match, but still overpredicts the abundance of rare objects at all times by up to 50 per cent. Finally, we consider the consequences of the recently released WMAP 3-yr cosmological parameters. These lead to much less structure at high redshift, reducing the number of z = 10 'mini-haloes' by more than a factor of two and the number of z = 30 galaxy hosts by nearly four orders of magnitude.

   abstract = {The dark matter halo mass function is a key repository of cosmological information over a wide range of mass scales, from individual galaxies to galaxy clusters. N-body simulations have established that the friends-of-friends (FOF) mass function has a universal form to a surprising level of accuracy (≲10%). The high-mass tail of the mass function is exponentially sensitive to the amplitude of the initial density perturbations, the mean matter density parameter, Ωm , and to the dark energy controlled late-time evolution of the density field. Observed group and cluster masses, however, are usually stated in terms of a spherical overdensity (SO) mass which does not map simply to the FOF mass. Additionally, the widely used halo models of structure formation - and halo occupancy distribution descriptions of galaxies within halos - are often constructed exploiting the universal form of the FOF mass function. This again raises the question of whether FOF halos can be simply related to the notion of a spherical overdensity mass. By employing results from Monte Carlo realizations of ideal Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) halos and N-body simulations, we study the relationship between the two definitions of halo mass. We find that the vast majority of halos (80%-85%) in the mass-range 10 12.5-1015.5 h -1 M⊙ indeed allow for an accurate mapping between the two definitions (∼5%), but only if the halo concentrations are known. Nonisolated halos fall into two broad classes: those with complex substructure that are poor fits to NFW profiles and those "bridged" by the (isodensity-based) FOF algorithm. A closer investigation of the bridged halos reveals that the fraction of these halos and their satellite mass distribution is cosmology dependent. We provide a preliminary discussion of the theoretical and observational ramifications of these results. © 2009. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {We investigate the impact finite simulation box size has on the structural and kinematic properties of cold dark matter (CDM) haloes forming in cosmological simulations. Our approach involves generating a single realization of the initial power spectrum of density perturbations and studying how truncation of this power spectrum on scales larger than Lcut = 2π/kcut affects the structure of dark matter haloes at z = 0. In particular, we have examined the cases of Lcut = fcut Lbox with fcut = 1 (i.e. no truncation), 1/2, 1/3 and 1/4. In common with previous studies, we find that the suppression of long wavelength perturbations reduces the strength of clustering, as measured by a suppression of the two-point correlation function ξ(r), and reduces the numbers of the most massive haloes, as reflected in the depletion of the high-mass end of the mass function n(M). However, we note that the number density of 'intermediate'-mass haloes (M ∼ 1013 h-1 M⊙) is enhanced by the suppression of long wavelength perturbations - by as much as ∼20 per cent for fcut = 1/4- and that this effect becomes more pronounced as f cut is decreased. Such a trend is in good agreement with the predictions of the Sheth-Tormen prescription. Interestingly, we find that truncation of the initial power spectrum has little impact on the internal properties of haloes. The masses of high-mass haloes decrease in a systematic manner as Lcut is reduced, but the distribution of concentrations is unaffected. On the other hand, the median spin parameter is ∼15 per cent lower in runs with fcut < 1. We argue that this is an imprint of the linear growth phase of the halo's angular momentum by tidal torquing, and that the absence of any measurable trend in concentration or halo shape reflects the importance of virialization and complex mass-accretion histories for these quantities. These results are of interest for studies that require high-mass resolution and statistical samples of simulated haloes, such as simulations of the population of first stars. Our analysis shows that large-scale tidal fields have relatively little effect on the internal properties of CDM haloes and hence may be ignored in these studies. © 2006 RAS.},

   abstract = {N-body simulations are a very important tool in the study of the formation of large-scale structures. Much of the progress in understanding the physics of the high-redshift universe and comparison with observations would not have been possible without N-body simulations. Given the importance of this tool, it is essential to understand its limitations, as ignoring the limitations can easily lead to interesting but unreliable results. In this paper we study the limitations arising out of the finite size of the simulation volume. This finite size implies that modes larger than the size of the simulation volume are ignored and a truncated power spectrum is simulated. If the simulation volume is large enough then the mass in collapsed haloes expected from the full power spectrum and from the truncated power spectrum should match. We propose a quantitative measure based on this approach that allows us to compute the minimum box size for an N-body simulation. We find that the required box size for simulations of the ACDM model at high redshifts is much larger than is typically used. We can also use this approach to quantify the effect of perturbations at large scales for power-law models and we find that if we fix the scale of non-linearity, the required box size becomes very large as the index becomes small. The appropriate box size computed using this approach is also an appropriate choice for the transition scale when tools like MAP, which add the contribution of the missing power, are used. © 2005 RAS.},

   abstract = {We study high-redshift structure formation and reionization in a ÃCDM universe under the assumption that the spectral power index of primordial density fluctuations is a function of length scale. We adopt a particular formulation of the '' running '' spectral index (RSI) model as suggested by the combined analysis of the recent Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) data and two other large-scale structure observations. We carry out high-resolution cosmological simulations and use them to study the formation of primordial gas clouds where the first stars are likely to form. While early structure forms hierarchically in the RSI model, quite similar to the standard power-law ÃCDM model, the reduced power on small scales causes a considerable delay in the formation epoch of low-mass ($10 6 M) '' minihalos '' compared with the ÃCDM model. The abundance of primordial star-forming gas clouds in such halos also differs by more than an order of magnitude at z > 15 between the two models. The extremely small number of gas clouds in the RSI model indicates that reionization is initiated later than z < 15, generally resulting in a smaller total Thomson optical depth than in the ÃCDM model. By carrying out radiative transfer calculations, we also study reionization by stellar populations formed in galaxies. We show that, in order to reionize the universe by z $ 7, the escape fraction of ultraviolet photons from galaxies in the RSI model must be as high as 0.6 throughout the redshift range 5 < z < 18 for a stellar population similar to that of the local universe. Even with a top-heavy initial mass function representing an early population of massive stars and/or an extraordinarily high photon emission rate from galaxies, the total optical depth can only be as large as e $ 0:1 for reasonable models of early star formation.

   abstract = {We use self-similarity in N-body simulations of scale-free models to test for resolution dependence in the mass function and two-point correlation functions of dark matter haloes. We use 10243 particle simulations performed with abacus, and compare results obtained with two halo finders: friends-of-friends (fof), and rockstar. The fof mass functions show a systematic deviation from self-similarity which is explained by resolution dependence of the fof mass assignment previously reported in the literature. Weak evidence for convergence is observed only starting from haloes of several thousand particles, and mass functions are overestimated by at least as much as $20-25\{\{\ \rm per\ cent\}\}$ for haloes of 50 particles. The mass function of the default rockstar halo catalogue (with bound virial spherical overdensity mass), on the other hand, shows good convergence of the order of 50 to 100 particles per halo, with no detectable evidence at the few percent level of any systematic dependence for larger particle number. Tests show that the mass unbinding procedure in rockstar is the key factor in obtaining this much improved resolution. Applying the same analysis to the halo-halo two point correlation function, we find again strong evidence for convergence only for rockstar haloes, at separations sufficiently large so that haloes do not overlap. At these separations, we can exclude dependence on resolution at the $5-10\{\{\ \rm per\ cent\}\}$ level once haloes have of the order of 50 to 100 particles. At smaller separations results are not converged even at significantly larger particle number, and bigger simulations would be required to establish the resolution required for convergence.},

   abstract = {This paper explores the self-similar solutions of the Vlasov-Poisson system and their relation to the gravitational collapse of dynamically cold systems. Analytic solutions are derived for power-law potentials in one dimension, and extensions of these solutions in three dimensions are proposed. Next, the self-similarity of the collapse of cold dynamical systems is investigated numerically. The fold system in phase space is consistent with analytic self-similar solutions, which present all the proper self-similar scaling. An additional point is the appearance of an x-1/2 law at the centre of the system for initial conditions with power-law index larger than -1/2(the Binney conjecture). It is found that the first appearance of the x-1/2 law corresponds to the formation of a singularity very close to the centre. Finally, the general properties of self-similar multidimensional solutions near equilibrium are investigated. Smooth and continuous self-similar solutions have power-law behaviour at equilibrium. However, cold initial conditions result in discontinuous phase-space solutions, and the smoothed phase-space density loses its auto-similar properties. This problem is easily solved by observing that the probability distribution of the phase-space density P is identical except for scaling parameters to the probability distribution of the smoothed phase-space density PS. As a consequence, PSinherits the self-similar properties of P. This particular property is at the origin of the universalpower law observed in numerical simulation for Ρ/Σ3. The self-similar properties of PS imply that other quantities should also have a universal power-law behaviour with predictable exponents. This hypothesis is tested using a numerical model of the phase-space density of cold dark matter haloes, and excellent agreement is obtained. © 2012 The Author.},

The survey has a uniform isophotal detection limit of 26 mag arcsec-2 and it provides a robust, well-defined catalogue of stars and galaxies in the range 16 ≤ BMGC < 24 mag. Here we describe the survey strategy, the photometric and astrometric calibration, source detection and analysis, and present the galaxy number counts that connect the bright and faint galaxy populations within a single survey. We argue that these counts represent the state of the art and use them to constrain the normalizations (φ*) of a number of recent estimates of the local galaxy luminosity function.

We show that the non-Gaussian errors can be important even on large length scales relevant for baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs). Our findings are the following: (1) the non-Gaussian errors degrade the cumulative signal-to-noise ratios (S/Ns) for the power spectrum amplitude by up to a factor of 2 and 4 for redshifts z = 1 and 0, respectively; (2) there is little information on the power spectrum amplitudes in the quasi-nonlinear regime, confirming the previous results; (3) the distribution of power spectrum estimators at BAO scales, among the realizations, is well approximated by a Gaussian distribution with variance that is given by the diagonal covariance component. (4) For the redshift-space power spectrum, the degradation in S/N by non-Gaussian errors is mitigated due to nonlinear redshift distortions; (5) for an actual galaxy survey, the additional shot noise contamination compromises the cosmological information inherent in the galaxy power spectrum, but also mitigates the impact of non-Gaussian errors. The S/N is degraded by up to 30% for a Wide-Field Fiber-Fed Optical Multi-Object Spectrograph-type survey; (6) the finite survey volume causes additional non-Gaussian errors via the correlations of long-wavelength fluctuations with the fluctuations we want to measure, further degrading the S/N values by about 30% even at high redshift z = 3.},

This is the first cosmological N-body simulation encompassing the full observable cosmic volume, thus allowing cosmic-variance limited predictions at BAOscales.We control the effect of numerical systematic errors using a series of large-volume high-resolution simulations. The combined analysis allows us to measure the matter power spectrum between z = 0 and 1 to 1 per cent over the entire BAO range, 0.03 < k[h Mpc-1] < 0.3, in bins of size δk/k ≲ 1 per cent. We define the BAO with respect to a non-linearly evolved wiggle-free spectrum and determine the characteristics of the BAO without recurring to extrapolation from global fitting functions. We quantify the effects of non-linearities on the position and amplitude of the BAO extrema, and the coupling to the broad-band slope of the power spectrum. We use these estimates to test non-linear predictions from semi-analytical models. Quite remarkably from the analysis of the redshift evolution of BAO we find that the second dip and third peak remains unaltered by non-linear effects. Furthermore, we find that the square of the damping factor and the shift of the position of BAO extrema scale to good approximation as the square of the growth factor, in agreement with expectations from perturbation theory. This confirms the idea that, besides cosmic distances, an accurate measurement of BAO at different redshifts can directly probe the growth of cosmic structures. © 2014 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

   abstract = {Future galaxy surveys require one percent precision in the theoretical knowledge of the power spectrum over a large range including very nonlinear scales. While this level of accuracy is easily obtained in the linear regime with perturbation theory, it represents a serious challenge for small scales where numerical simulations are required. In this paper we quantify the precision of present-day N-body methods, identifying main potential error sources from the set-up of initial conditions to the measurement of the final power spectrum. We directly compare three widely used N-body codes, Ramses, Pkdgrav3, and Gadget3 which represent three main discretisation techniques: the particle-mesh method, the tree method, and a hybrid combination of the two. For standard run parameters, the codes agree to within one percent at k1 h Mpc-1 and to within three percent at k10 h Mpc-1. We also consider the bispectrum and show that the reduced bispectra agree at the sub-percent level for k 2 h Mpc-1. In a second step, we quantify potential errors due to initial conditions, box size, and resolution using an extended suite of simulations performed with our fastest code Pkdgrav3. We demonstrate that the simulation box size should not be smaller than L=0.5 h-1Gpc to avoid systematic finite-volume effects (while much larger boxes are required to beat down the statistical sample variance). Furthermore, a maximum particle mass of Mp=109 h-1Mo is required to conservatively obtain one percent precision of the matter power spectrum. As a consequence, numerical simulations covering large survey volumes of upcoming missions such as DES, LSST, and Euclid will need more than a trillion particles to reproduce clustering properties at the targeted accuracy.},

   abstract = {Deep pencil beam surveys (<1 deg2) are of fundamental importance for studying the high-redshift universe. However, inferences about galaxy population properties (e.g., the abundance of objects) are in practice limited by "cosmic variance." This is the uncertainty in observational estimates of the number density of galaxies arising from the underlying large-scale density fluctuations. This source of uncertainty can be significant, especially for surveys which cover only small areas and for massive high-redshift galaxies. Cosmic variance for a given galaxy population can be determined using predictions from cold dark matter theory and the galaxy bias. In this paper, we provide tools for experiment design and interpretation. For a given survey geometry, we present the cosmic variance of dark matter as a function of mean redshift z̄ and redshift bin size Δz. Using a halo occupation model to predict galaxy clustering, we derive the galaxy bias as a function of mean redshift for galaxy samples of a given stellar mass range. In the linear regime, the cosmic variance of these galaxy samples is the product of the galaxy bias and the dark matter cosmic variance. We present a simple recipe using a fitting function to compute cosmic variance as a function of the angular dimensions of the field, z̄, Δz, and stellar mass m *. We also provide tabulated values and a software tool. The accuracy of the resulting cosmic variance estimates (δσv/ σv) is shown to be better than 20%. We find that for GOODS at z̄ = 2 and with Δz = 0.5, the relative cosmic variance of galaxies with m *>1011 M ⊙ is ∼38%, while it is ∼27% for GEMS and 12% for COSMOS. For galaxies of m * 1010 M ⊙, the relative cosmic variance is ∼19% for GOODS, ∼13% for GEMS, and ∼6% for COSMOS. This implies that cosmic variance is a significant source of uncertainty at z̄ = 2 for small fields and massive galaxies, while for larger fields and intermediate mass galaxies, cosmic variance is less serious. © 2011.

   abstract = {We determine an expression for the cosmic variance of any 'normal' galaxy survey based on examination of M* ± 1 mag galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 (DR7) data cube. We find that cosmic variance will depend on a number of factors principally: total survey volume, survey aspect ratio and whether the area surveyed is contiguous or comprising independent sightlines. As a rule of thumb cosmic variance falls below 10 per cent once a volume of 107 h-30.7 Mpc3 is surveyed for a single contiguous region with a 1:1 aspect ratio. Cosmic variance will be lower for higher aspect ratios and/or non-contiguous surveys. Extrapolating outside our test region we infer that cosmic variance in the entire SDSS DR7 main survey region is ~7 per cent to z < 0.1. The equation obtained from the SDSS DR7 region can be generalized to estimate the cosmic variance for any density measurement determined from normal galaxies (e.g. luminosity densities, stellar mass densities and cosmic star formation rates) within the volume range 103-107 h-30.7 Mpc3. We apply our equation to show that two sightlines are required to ensure that cosmic variance is <10 per cent in any ASKAP galaxy survey (divided into Δz ~ 0.1 intervals, i.e. ~1Gyr intervals for z < 0.5). Likewise 10 MeerKAT sightlines will be required to meet the same conditions. GAMA, VVDS and zCOSMOS all suffer less than 10 per cent cosmic variance (~3-8 per cent) in Δz intervals of 0.1, 0.25 and 0.5, respectively. Finally we show that cosmic variance is potentially at the 50-70 per cent level, or greater, in the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Ultra Deep Field depending on assumptions as to the evolution of clustering. 100 or 10 independent sightlines will be required to reduce cosmic variance to a manageable level (<10 per cent) for HST ACS or HST WFC3 surveys, respectively (in Δz ~ 1 intervals). Cosmic variance is therefore a significant factor in the z > 6 HST studies currently underway. © 2010 The Authors. Journal compilation. © 2010 RAS.},

   abstract = {Cosmic variance is the uncertainty in observational estimates of the volume density of extragalactic objects such as galaxies or quasars arising from the underlying large-scale density fluctuations. This is often a significant source of uncertainty, especially in deep galaxy surveys, which tend to cover relatively small areas. We present estimates of the relative cosmic variance for one-point statistics (i.e. number densities) for typical scales and volumes sampled by the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS). We use two approaches: for objects with a known two-point correlation function that is well-approximated by a power law, one can use the standard analytic formalism to calculate the cosmic variance (in excess of shot noise). We use this approach to estimate the cosmic variance for several populations that are being studied in the GOODS program: Extremely Red Objects (ERO) at z~1, and Lyman Break Galaxies (LBG) at z~3 and z~4, using clustering information for similar populations in the literature. For populations with unknown clustering, one can use predictions from Cold Dark Matter theory to obtain a rough estimate of the variance as a function of number density. We present a convenient plot which allows one to use this approach to read off the cosmic variance for a population with a known mean redshift and estimated number density. We conclude that for the volumes sampled by GOODS, cosmic variance is a significant source of uncertainty for strongly clustered objects (~40-60% for EROs) and less serious for less clustered objects, ~10-20% for LBGs.},

The new code can deal with tens of millions of particles on current computers, with the calculation done on a parallel supercomputer or a group of workstations. Typically, the spatial resolution is enhanced by more than a factor of 20 over the pure PM code with mass resolution retained at nearly the PM level. This code runs much faster than a pure TREE code with the same number of particles and maintains almost the same resolution in high density regions. Multiple time step integration has also been implemented with the code, with second order time accuracy. The performance of the code has been checked in several kinds of parallel computer configuration, including IBM SP1, SGI Challenge and a group of workstations, with the speedup of the parallel code on a 32 processor IBM SP2 supercomputer nearly linear (efficiency $\approx 80\%$) in the number of processors.

We release for public use a cosmological PM N-body code. We provide a complete package of routines needed to set initial conditions, to run the code, and to analyze the results. The package allows you to simulate models with numerous combinations of parameters: open/flat/closed background, with or without the cosmological constant, different values of the Hubble constant, with or without hot neutrinos, tilted or non-tilted initial spectra, different amount of baryons. Routines are included to measure the power spectrum and the density distribution function in your simulations, and a bound-density-maxima code for halo finding. We also provide results of test runs. A simulation with 256^3 mesh and 128^3 particles can be done in a couple of days on a typical workstation (70Mb of RAM are needed). To run simulations with 800^3 mesh and 256^3 particles one needs a computer with 1Gb memory and 1Gb disk space. The code has been successfully tested on an HP workstation and on a Sun workstation running Solaris. Most of the files (not tests) can be obtained from ftp://astro.nmsu.edu/pub/aklypin/PMCODE The package can be downloaded from http://astro.nmsu.edu/~aklypin/PM/pmcode/index.html We provide this tool as a service to the astronomical community, but we cannot guarantee results or publications.},

More specifically, the finite box size leads to a significant underestimate of sigma_8, the correlation function, and nonlinear effects. I implement a method of generating initial conditions for N-body simulations that accurately models the real-space statistical properties, such as the mass variance in spheres and the correlation function. The method requires running ensembles of simulations because the power in the DC mode is no longer assumed to be zero. For moderately sized boxes, I demonstrate that the new method corrects the underestimate in the mass variance in spheres and the shape of the correlation function. I also argue that subtracting Poisson noise from the power spectrum is a dangerous practice.

We quantify the structural properties of the inner dark matter distribution and study how they depend on numerical resolution. We can measure the density profile to a distance of 120 pc (0.05 per cent of Rvir), where the logarithmic slope is -0.8 and -1.4 at (0.5 per cent of Rvir). We propose a new two-parameter fitting function that has a linearly varying logarithmic density gradient over the resolved radii which fits the GHALO and VL2 density profiles extremely well. Convergence in the halo shape is achieved at roughly three times the convergence radius for the density profile at which point the halo becomes more spherical due to numerical resolution. The six-dimensional phase-space profile is dominated by the presence of the substructures and does not follow a power law, except in the central few kpc which is devoid of substructure even at this resolution. The quantity, ρ/σ3, which is often used as a proxy for the six-dimensional phase-space density should be used with caution. © 2009 The Authors. Journal compilation © 2009 RAS.},

We show self-consistency in the mass function and mass power spectrum at the 1% level over a range of more than 1000 in particle mass.

The suite contains 48 Galaxy-size haloes, each within high-resolution volumes that span 2-5 Mpc in size, and each resolving thousands of systems with masses below the atomic cooling limit. Half of the ELVIS galaxy haloes are in paired configurations similar to the Milky Way (MW) and M31; the other half are isolated, mass-matched analogues. We find no difference in the abundance or kinematics of substructure within the virial radii of isolated versus paired hosts. On Mpc scales, however, LG-like pairs average almost twice as many companions and the velocity field is kinematically hotter and more complex. We present a refined abundance matching relation between stellar mass and halo mass that reproduces the observed satellite stellar mass functions of the MW and M31 down to the regime where incompleteness is an issue, M* ̃ 5 × 105M⊙. Within a larger region spanning approximately 3Mpc, the same relation predicts that there should be ̃1000 galaxies with M* > 103M⊙ awaiting discovery. We show that up to 50 per cent of haloes within 1Mpc of the MW or M31 could be systems that have previously been within the virial radius of either giant. By associating never accreted haloes with gas-rich dwarfs, we show that there are plausibly 50 undiscovered dwarf galaxies with HI masses >105M⊙ within the local volume.

   abstract = {We introduce the Phoenix Project, a set of Λ cold dark matter (CDM) simulations of the dark matter component of nine rich galaxy clusters. Each cluster is simulated at least at two different numerical resolutions. For eight of them, the highest resolution corresponds to ∼130 million particles within the virial radius, while for one this number is over one billion. We study the structure and substructure of these systems and contrast them with six galaxy-sized dark matter haloes from the Aquarius Project, simulated at comparable resolution. This comparison highlights the approximate mass invariance of CDM halo structure and substructure. We find little difference in the spherically averaged mass, pseudo-phase-space density and velocity anisotropy profiles of Aquarius and Phoenix haloes. When scaled to the virial properties of the host halo, the abundance and radial distribution of subhaloes are also very similar, despite the fact that Aquarius and Phoenix haloes differ by roughly three decades in virial mass. The most notable difference is that cluster haloes have been assembled more recently and are thus significantly less relaxed than galaxy haloes, which leads to decreased regularity, increased halo-to-halo scatter and sizable deviations from the mean trends. This accentuates the effects of the strong asphericity of individual clusters on surface density profiles, which may vary by up to a factor of 3 at a given radius, depending on projection. The high apparent concentration reported for some strong-lensing clusters might very well reflect these effects. A more recent assembly also explains why substructure in some Phoenix haloes is slightly more abundant than in Aquarius, especially in the inner regions. Resolved subhaloes nevertheless contribute only 11 ± 3 per cent of the virial mass in Phoenix clusters. Together, the Phoenix and Aquarius simulation series provide a detailed and comprehensive prediction of the CDM distribution in galaxies and clusters when the effects of baryons can be neglected. © 2012 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society © 2012 RAS.},

We have also simulated a sample of six ultrahighly resolved Milky Way sized haloes, allowing us to estimate the halo-to-halo scatter in substructure statistics. In our largest simulation, we resolve nearly 300 000 gravitationally bound subhaloes within the virialized region of the halo. Simulations of the same object differing in mass resolution by factors of up to 1800 accurately reproduce the largest subhaloes with the same mass, maximum circular velocity and position, and yield good convergence for the abundance and internal properties of dark matter substructures. We detect up to four generations of subhaloes within subhaloes, but contrary to recent claims, we find less substructure in subhaloes than in the main halo when regions of equal mean overdensity are compared. The overall substructure mass fraction is much lower in subhaloes than in the main halo. Extrapolating the main halo's subhalo mass spectrum down to an Earth mass, we predict the mass fraction in substructure to be well below 3 per cent within 100 kpc, and to be below 0.1 per cent within the solar circle. The inner density profiles of subhaloes show no sign of converging to a fixed asymptotic slope and are well fitted by gently curving profiles of Einasto form. The mean concentrations of isolated haloes are accurately described by the fitting formula of Neto et al. down to maximum circular velocities of 1.5 km s -1, an extrapolation over some five orders of magnitude in mass. However, at equal maximum circular velocity, subhaloes are more concentrated than field haloes, with a characteristic density that is typically ∼2.6 times larger and increases with decreasing distance from halo centre. © 2008 RAS.},

We find that the analytic formulae provide a good description of the relations between three of the four numerical quantities. The fourth (luminosity) also agrees once we introduce a procedure to correct for the fixed numerical resolution. We also compute the normalizations for the virial relations and compare extensively to the existing literature, finding remarkably good agreement. The Press-Schechter prescription is calibrated with the simulations, again finding results consistent with other authors. We also examine related issues such as the size of the scatter in the virial relations, the effect of metallicity with a fixed pass-band, and the structure of the halos. All of this is done in order to establish a firm groundwork for the use of clusters as cosmological probes. Implications for the models are briefly discussed.},

We measure the power spectrum, monopole and quadrupole redshift-space correlation functions, halo mass function and reduced bispectrum at z = 1. By these measures, predictions from a fixed pair can be as precise on non-linear scales as an average over 50 traditional simulations. The fixing procedure introduces a non-Gaussian correction to the initial conditions; we give an analytic argument showing why the simulations are still able to predict the mean properties of the Gaussian ensemble.We anticipate that the method will drive down the computational time requirements for accurate large-scale explorations of galaxy bias and clustering statistics, and facilitating the use of numerical simulations in cosmological data interpretation.},

We create sky maps and identify large samples of galaxy clusters using surrogates for four different observables: richness estimated from galaxy surveys, X-ray luminosity, integrated Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) signal and lensing mass. The unprecedented combination of volume and resolution allows us to explore in detail how these observables scale with each other and with cluster mass. The scatter correlates between different mass-observable relations because of common sensitivities to the internal structure, orientation and environment of clusters, as well as to line-of-sight superposition of uncorrelated structure. We show that this can account for the apparent discrepancies uncovered recently between the mean thermal SZ signals measured for optically and X-ray selected clusters by stacking data from the Planck satellite. Related systematics can also affect inferences from extreme clusters detected at high redshift. Our results illustrate that cosmological conclusions from galaxy cluster surveys depend critically on proper modelling, not only of the relevant physics, but also of the full distribution of the observables and of the selection biases induced by cluster identification procedures. © 2012 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. © 2012 RAS.},

These codes span a wide range of techniques including friends-of-friends, spherical-overdensity and phase-space-based algorithms. We further introduce a robust (and publicly available) suite of test scenarios that allow halo finder developers to compare the performance of their codes against those presented here. This set includes mock haloes containing various levels and distributions of substructure at a range of resolutions as well as a cosmological simulation of the large-scale structure of the universe. All the halo-finding codes tested could successfully recover the spatial location of our mock haloes. They further returned lists of particles (potentially) belonging to the object that led to coinciding values for the maximum of the circular velocity profile and the radius where it is reached. All the finders based in configuration space struggled to recover substructure that was located close to the centre of the host halo, and the radial dependence of the mass recovered varies from finder to finder. Those finders based in phase space could resolve central substructure although they found difficulties in accurately recovering its properties. Through a resolution study we found that most of the finders could not reliably recover substructure containing fewer than 30-40 particles. However, also here the phase-space finders excelled by resolving substructure down to 10-20 particles. By comparing the halo finders using a high-resolution cosmological volume, we found that they agree remarkably well on fundamental properties of astrophysical significance (e.g. mass, position, velocity and peak of the rotation curve). We further suggest to utilize the peak of the rotation curve, vmax, as a proxy for mass, given the arbitrariness in defining a proper halo edge. © 2011 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society © 2011 RAS.},

   abstract = {We simulate the assembly of a massive rich cluster and the formation of its constituent galaxies in a flat, low-density universe. Our most accurate model follows the collapse, the star formation history and the orbital motion of all galaxies more luminous than the Fornax dwarf spheroidal, while dark halo structure is tracked consistently throughout the cluster for all galaxies more luminous than the SMC. Within its virial radius this model contains about 2 × 107 dark matter particles and almost 5000 distinct dynamically resolved galaxies. Simulations of this same cluster at a variety of resolutions allow us to check explicitly for numerical convergence both of the dark matter structures produced by our new parallel N-body and substructure identification codes, and of the galaxy populations produced by the phenomenological models we use to follow cooling, star formation, feedback and stellar aging. This baryonic modelling is tuned so that our simulations reproduce the observed properties of isolated spirals outside clusters. Without further parameter adjustment our simulations then produce a luminosity function, a mass-to-light ratio, luminosity, number and velocity dispersion profiles, and a morphology-radius relation which are similar to those observed in real clusters. In particular, since our simulations follow galaxy merging explicitly, we can demonstrate that it accounts quantitatively for the observed cluster population of bulges and elliptical galaxies.},

   abstract = {We combine data from a number of N-body simulations to predict the abundance of dark haloes in cold dark matter (CDM) universes over more than four orders of magnitude in mass. A comparison of different simulations suggests that the dominant uncertainty in our results is systematic and is smaller than 10-30 per cent at all masses, depending on the halo definition used. In particular, our 'Hubble volume' simulations of τCDM and ΛCDM cosmologies allow the abundance of massive clusters to be predicted with uncertainties well below those expected in all currently planned observational surveys. We show that for a range of CDM cosmologies and for a suitable halo definition, the simulated mass function is almost independent of epoch, of cosmological parameters and of the initial power spectrum when expressed in appropriate variables. This universality is of exactly the kind predicted by the familiar Press-Schechter model, although this model predicts a mass function shape that differs from our numerical results, overestimating the abundance of 'typical' haloes and underestimating that of massive systems.},

Mapping past light-cones of locations in the computational space, we create mock sky surveys of dark matter structure to z~1.4 over 10,000 sq deg and to z~0.5 over two full spheres. Calibrating the Jenkins mass function at z=0 with samples of ~1.5 million clusters, we show that the fit describes the sky survey counts to <~20% acccuracy over all redshifts for systems larger than poor groups (M>5e13 Msun/h). Fitting the observed local temperature function determines the ratio beta of specific thermal energies in dark matter and intracluster gas. We derive a scaling with power spectrum normalization beta \propto sigma8^\{5/3\}, and measure a 4% error on sigma8 arising from cosmic variance in temperature-limited cluster samples. Considering distant clusters, the LCDM model matches EMSS and RDCS X-ray-selected survey observations under economical assumptions for intracluster gas evolution. Using transformations of mass-limited cluster samples that mimic sigma8 variation, we explore SZ search expectations for a 10 sq deg survey complete above 10^\{14\} Msun/h. Cluster counts are shown to be extremely sensitive to sigma8 uncertainty while redshift statistics, such as the sample median, are much more stable. For LCDM, the characteristic temperature at fixed sky surface density is a weak function of redshift, implying an abundance of hot clusters at z>1. Assuming constant beta, four kT>8 keV clusters lie at z>2 and 40 kT>5 keV clusters lie at z>3 on the whole sky. Detection of Coma-sized clusters at z>1 violate LCDM at 95% confidence if their surface density exceeds 0.003 per sq deg, or 120 on the whole sky.},

   abstract = {Observational cosmology in the next decade will rely on probes of the distribution of matter in the redshift range between $0<z<3$ to elucidate the nature of dark matter and dark energy. In this redshift range, galaxy formation is known to have a significant impact on observables such as two-point correlations of galaxy shapes and positions, altering their amplitude and scale dependence beyond the expected statistical uncertainty of upcoming experiments at separations under 10 Mpc. Successful extraction of information in such a regime thus requires, at the very least, unbiased models for the impact of galaxy formation on the matter distribution, and can benefit from complementary observational priors. This work reviews the current state of the art in the modelling of baryons for cosmology, from numerical methods to approximate analytical prescriptions, and makes recommendations for studies in the next decade, including a discussion of potential probe combinations that can help constrain the role of baryons in cosmological studies. We focus, in particular, on the modelling of the matter power spectrum, $P(k,z)$, as a function of scale and redshift, and of the observables derived from this quantity. This work is the result of a workshop held at the University of Oxford in November of 2018.},

@article{Rockstar13,
   abstract = {We present a new algorithm for identifying dark matter halos, substructure, and tidal features. The approach is based on adaptive hierarchical refinement of friends-of-friends groups in six phase-space dimensions and one time dimension, which allows for robust (grid-independent, shape-independent, and noise-resilient) tracking of substructure; as such, it is named ROCKSTAR (Robust Overdensity Calculation using K-Space Topologically Adaptive Refinement). Our method is massively parallel (up to 105 CPUs) and runs on the largest current simulations (>1010 particles) with high efficiency (10 CPU hours and 60 gigabytes of memory required per billion particles analyzed). A previous paper has shown ROCKSTAR to have excellent recovery of halo properties; we expand on these comparisons with more tests and higher-resolution simulations. We show a significant improvement in substructure recovery compared to several other halo finders and discuss the theoretical and practical limits of simulations in this regard. Finally, we present results that demonstrate conclusively that dark matter halo cores are not at rest relative to the halo bulk or substructure average velocities and have coherent velocity offsets across a wide range of halo masses and redshifts. For massive clusters, these offsets can be up to 350 km s-1 at z = 0 and even higher at high redshifts. Our implementation is publicly available at http://code.google. com/p/rockstar. © 2013.

   abstract = {We investigate how different cosmological parameters, such as those delivered by the WMAP and Planck missions, affect the nature and evolution of the dark matter halo substructure. We use a series of flat Λ cold dark matter cosmological N-body simulations of structure formation, each with a different power spectrum but with the same initial white noise field. Our fiducial simulation is based on parameters from the WMAP seventh year cosmology. We then systematically vary the spectral index, ns ; matter density, ΩM ; and normalization of the power spectrum, σ8, for seven unique simulations. Across these, we study variations in the subhalo mass function, mass fraction, maximum circular velocity function, spatial distribution, concentration, formation times, accretion times, and peak mass. We eliminate dependence of subhalo properties on host halo mass and average the values over many hosts to reduce variance. While the "same" subhalos from identical initial overdensity peaks in higher σ8, ns , and Ωm simulations accrete earlier and end up less massive and closer to the halo center at z = 0, the process of continuous subhalo accretion and destruction leads to a steady state distribution of these properties across all subhalos in a given host. This steady state mechanism eliminates cosmological dependence on all of the properties listed above except for subhalo concentration and Vmax, which remain greater for higher σ8, ns , and Ωm simulations, and subhalo formation time, which remains earlier. We also find that the numerical technique for computing the scale radius and the halo finder that were used can significantly affect the concentration-mass relationship as computed for a simulation. © 2014.

   abstract = {QUANTUM gravitational effects are usually ignored in calculations of the formation and evolution of black holes. The justification for this is that the radius of curvature of space-time outside the event horizon is very large compared to the Planck length (Gℏ/c3)1/2 ≈ 10-33 cm, the length scale on which quantum fluctuations of the metric are expected to be of order unity. This means that the energy density of particles created by the gravitational field is small compared to the space-time curvature. Even though quantum effects may be small locally, they may still, however, add up to produce a significant effect over the lifetime of the Universe ≈ 1017 s which is very long compared to the Planck time ≈ 10-43 s. The purpose of this letter is to show that this indeed may be the case: it seems that any black hole will create and emit particles such as neutrinos or photons at just the rate that one would expect if the black hole was a body with a temperature of (κ/2π) (ℏ/2k) ≈ 10-6 (M⊙/M)K where κ is the surface gravity of the black hole1. As a black hole emits this thermal radiation one would expect it to lose mass. This in turn would increase the surface gravity and so increase the rate of emission. The black hole would therefore have a finite life of the order of 1071 (M⊙/M)-3 s. For a black hole of solar mass this is much longer than the age of the Universe. There might, however, be much smaller black holes which were formed by fluctuations in the early Universe2. Any such black hole of mass less than 1015 g would have evaporated by now. Near the end of its life the rate of emission would be very high and about 1030 erg would be released in the last 0.1 s. This is a fairly small explosion by astronomical standards but it is equivalent to about 1 million 1 Mton hydrogen bombs. © 1974 Nature Publishing Group.},

For t > t p , the energy density of the universe, for /c < 0 (where k is the geometric constant in the Robertson-Walker metric), is eventually dominated by the contribution of a very tenuous e + e~ plasma, much too thin for direct e + e~ annihilation and perhaps too thin for gravitational collapse. For a closed (cyclical) universe, current ideas in particle physics imply that the baryon to photon ratio will be identical for each cycle ; thus the effect of entropy production will be to enlarge the cosmic scale, from cycle to cycle, by a cycle expansion factor a.

   abstract = {The friends-of-friends algorithm (hereafter FOF) is a percolation algorithm which is routinely used to identify dark matter halos from N-body simulations. We use results from percolation theory to show that the boundary of FOF halos does not correspond to a single density threshold but to a range of densities close to a critical value that depends upon the linking length parameter, b. We show that for the commonly used choice of b = 0.2, this critical density is equal to 81.62 times the mean matter density. Consequently, halos identified by the FOF algorithm enclose an average overdensity which depends on their density profile (concentration) and therefore changes with halo mass, contrary to the popular belief that the average overdensity is ∼180. We derive an analytical expression for the overdensity as a function of the linking length parameter b and the concentration of the halo. Results of tests carried out using simulated and actual FOF halos identified in cosmological simulations show excellent agreement with our analytical prediction. We also find that the mass of the halo that the FOF algorithm selects crucially depends upon mass resolution. We find a percolation-theory-motivated formula that is able to accurately correct for the dependence on number of particles for the mock realizations of spherical and triaxial Navarro-Frenk-White halos. However, we show that this correction breaks down when applied to the real cosmological FOF halos due to the presence of substructures. Given that abundance of substructure depends on redshift and cosmology, we expect that the resolution effects due to substructure on the FOF mass and halo mass function will also depend on redshift and cosmology and will be difficult to correct for in general. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for the universality of the mass function. © 2011. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.},

These descriptions are employed to quantify the amplitude and location of baryonic features in linear theory. While baryonic oscillations are prominent if the baryon fraction exceeds $\Omega_0 h^2 + 0.2$, the main effect in more conventional cosmologies is a sharp suppression in the transfer function below the sound horizon. We provide a simple but accurate description of this effect and stress that it is not well approximated by a change in the shape parameter $\Gamma$.},

We then cover the basic statistical tools used in cosmology to describe cosmic fields, such as correlation functions in real and Fourier space, probability distribution functions, cumulants and generating functions. In subsequent sections we review the use of PT to make quantitative predictions about these statistics according to initial conditions, including effects of possible non-Gaussianity of the primordial fields. Results are illustrated by detailed comparisons of PT predictions with numerical simulations. The last sections deal with applications to observations. First, we review in detail practical estimators of statistics in galaxy catalogs and related errors, including traditional approaches and more recent developments. Then, we consider the effects of the bias between the galaxy distribution and the matter distribution, the treatment of redshift distortions in three-dimensional surveys and of projection effects in angular catalogs, and some applications to weak gravitational lensing.

   abstract = {This paper deals with the time evolution in the matter era of perturbations in Friedman-Lemaitre models with arbitrary density parameter $\Omega$, with either a zero cosmological constant, $\Lambda = 0$, or with a non-zero cosmological constant in a spatially flat Universe. Unlike the classical Eulerian approach where the density contrast is expanded in a perturbative series, this analysis relies instead on a perturbative expansion of particles trajectories in Lagrangian coordinates. This brings a number of advantages over the classical analysis. In particular, it enables the description of stronger density contrasts. Indeed the linear term is the famous Zel'dovich approximate solution (1970). We present here a systematic and detailed account of this approach. We give analytical results (or fits to numerical results) up to the third order. We then proceed to explore the link between the lagrangian description and statistical measures. We show in particular that Lagrangian perturbation theory provides a natural framework to compute the effect of redshift distortions, using the skewness of the density distribution function as an example. Finally, we show how well the second order theory does as compared to other approximat- ions in the case of spherically symmetric perturbations. We also compare this second order approximation and Zel'dovich solution to N-body simulations in the description of large-scale structure formation starting from a power law (n=-2) power spectrum of Gaussian perturbation. We find that second order theory is both simple and powerful.},

In this paper we study the dynamics of pancake models as a first step. In previous work (Coles \etal 1993, Melott \etal 1993, Melott 1993) the accuracy of several analytical approximations for the modeling of large-scale structure in the mildly non-linear regime was analyzed in the same way, allowing for direct comparison of the accuracy of various approximations. In particular, the ``Zel'dovich approximation'' (Zel'dovich 1970, 1973, hereafter ZA) as a subclass of the first-order Lagrangian perturbation solutions was found to provide an excellent approximation to the density field in the mildly non-linear regime (i.e. up to a linear r.m.s. density contrast of $\sigma \approx 2$). The performance of ZA in hierarchical clustering models can be greatly improved by truncating the initial power spectrum (smoothing the initial data). We here explore whether this approximation can be further improved with higher-order corrections in the displacement mapping from homogeneity.

We first show how to generate nonlocal PNG initial conditions with minimal overhead compared to local PNG models for a general class of primordial bispectra that can be written as linear combinations of separable templates. We run cosmological simulations for the local, and nonlocal equilateral and orthogonal models and present results on the scale dependence of halo bias. We also derive a general formula for the Fourier-space bias using the peak-background split in the context of the excursion-set approach to halos and discuss the difference and similarities with the known corresponding result from local bias models. Our peak-background split bias formula generalizes previous results in the literature to include non-Markovian effects and nonuniversality of the mass function and are in better agreement with measurements in numerical simulations than previous results for a variety of halo masses, redshifts and halo definitions. We also derive for the first time quadratic bias results for arbitrary nonlocal PNG, and show that nonlinear bias loops give small corrections at large scales. The resulting well-behaved perturbation theory paves the way to constrain nonlocal PNG from measurements of the power spectrum and bispectrum in galaxy redshift surveys. © 2012 American Physical Society.},

@article{Scoccimarro1998,
   abstract = {The standard procedure to generate initial conditions in numerical simulations of structure formations is to use the Zel'dovich approximation (ZA). Although the ZA correctly reproduces the linear growing modes of density and velocity perturbations, non-linear growth is inaccurately represented, particularly for velocity perturbations because of the ZA failure to conserve momentum. This implies that it takes time for the actual dynamics to establish the correct statistical properties of density and velocity fields. We extend the standard formulation of non-linear perturbation theory (PT) to include transients as non-linear excitations of decaying modes caused by the initial conditions. These new non-linear solutions interpolate between the initial conditions and the late-time solutions given by the exact non-linear dynamics. To quantify the magnitude of transients, we focus on higher order statistics of the density contrast δ and velocity divergence Θ, characterized by the Sp and Tp parameters. These describe the non-Gaussianity of the probability distribution through its connected moments 〈δp〉c ≡ Sp 〈δ2〉p-1, 〈Θp〉c& ≡ Tp 〈Θ2〉p-1. We calculate Sp(a) and Tp(a) to leading order in PT with top-hat smoothing as a function of the scale factor a. We find that the time-scale of transients is determined, at a given order p, by the effective spectral index neff. The skewness factor S3(T3) attains 10 per cent accuracy only after a ≈ 6 (a ≈ 15) for neff ≈ 0, whereas higher (lower) neff demands more (less) expansion away from the initial conditions. These requirements become much more stringent as p increases, always showing slower decay of transients for Tp than Sp. For models with density parameter Ω ≠ 1, the conditions above apply to the linear growth factor; thus an Ω = 0.3 open model requires roughly a factor of 2 larger expansion than a critical density model to reduce transients by the same amount. The predicted transients in Sp are in good agreement with numerical simulations. More accurate initial conditions can be achieved by using second-order Lagrangian PT (2LPT), which reproduces growing modes up to second order and thus eliminates transients in the skewness parameters. We show that for p > 3 this scheme can reduce the required expansion by more than an order of magnitude compared to the ZA. Setting up 2LPT initial conditions requires only minimal, inexpensive changes to ZA codes. We suggest simple steps for its implementation.},

This process simulates the formation of the large-scale structure of the Universe from an initially almost homogeneous medium. In the one-and two-dimensional cases of this numerical experiment the evolution of the system from 4096 point masses that interact gravi-tationally only was studied with periodic boundary conditions (simulation of the infinite space). The initial conditions were chosen that resulted from the theory of the evolution of small perturbations in the expanding Universe. The results of numerical experiments are systematically compared with the approximate analytic theory. The results of the calculations show that in the case of collisionless particles, as well as in the gas-dynamic case, the cellular structure appeared at the non-linear stage (when 5p/p > 1) in the case of the adiabatic perturbations. The greater part of the matter is in thin layers that separate vast regions of low density. In a Robertson-Walker universe (£2 = 1) the cellular structure exists for a finite time and then fragments into a few compact objects. In the open Universe (£2 < 1) the cellular structure also exists if the amplitude of initial perturbations is large enough. But the following disruption of the cellular structure is more difficult because of too rapid an expansion of the Universe. The large-scale structure is frozen. Formation of the cellular structure depends mainly on the choice of the spectrum of initial perturbations (short waves must be suppressed).},

Across the entire host halo mass range, the highest-resolution regions in these simulations are resolved with a dark matter particle mass of ≈3 × 10 −7 times the host virial mass and a Plummer-equivalent gravitational softening length of ≈9 × 10 −4 times the host virial radius, on average. We measure correlations between subhalo abundance and host concentration, formation time, and maximum subhalo mass, all of which peak at the Milky Way host halo mass scale. Subhalo abundances are ≈50% higher in clusters than in lower-mass hosts at fixed sub-to-host halo mass ratios. Subhalo radial distributions are approximately self-similar as a function of host mass and are less concentrated than hosts’ underlying dark matter distributions. We compare our results to the semianalytic model Galacticus , which predicts subhalo mass functions with a higher normalization at the low-mass end and radial distributions that are slightly more concentrated than Symphony. We use UniverseMachine to model halo and subhalo star formation histories in Symphony, and we demonstrate that these predictions resolve the formation histories of the halos that host nearly all currently observable satellite galaxies in the universe.

   abstract = {A new N-body and hydrodynamical code, called RAMSES, is presented. It has been designed to study structure formation in the universe with high spatial resolution. The code is based on Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) technique, with a tree-based data structure allowing recursive grid refinements on a cell-by-cell basis. The N-body solver is very similar to the one developed for the ART code (Kravtsov et al. 1997), with minor differences in the exact implementation. The hydrodynamical solver is based on a second-order Godunov method, a modern shock-capturing scheme known to compute accurately the thermal history of the fluid component. The accuracy of the code is carefully estimated using various test cases, from pure gas dynamical tests to cosmological ones. The specific refinement strategy used in cosmological simulations is described, and potential spurious effects associated with shock waves propagation in the resulting AMR grid are discussed and found to be negligible. Results obtained in a large N-body and hydrodynamical simulation of structure formation in a low density ΛCDM universe are reported, with 256 3 particles and 4.1 × 10 7 cells in the AMR grid, reaching a formal resolution of 8192 3. A convergence analysis of different quantities, such as dark matter density power spectrum, gas pressure power spectrum and individual haloe temperature profiles, shows that numerical results are converging down to the actual resolution limit of the code, and are well reproduced by recent analytical predictions in the framework of the halo model.},

The code is Cartesian, can be run in one, two, and three dimensions, and supports a wide variety of physics including hydrodynamics, ideal and non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics, N-body dynamics (and, more broadly, self-gravity of fluids and particles), primordial gas chemistry, optically thin radiative cooling of primordial and metal-enriched plasmas (as well as some optically-thick cooling models), radiation transport, cosmological expansion, and models for star formation and feedback in a cosmological context. In addition to explaining the algorithms implemented, we present solutions for a wide range of test problems, demonstrate the code's parallel performance, and discuss the Enzo collaboration's code development methodology. © 2014.

   abstract = {We discuss the cosmological simulation code GADGET-2, a new massively parallel TreeSPH code, capable of following a collisionless fluid with the N-body method, and an ideal gas by means of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Our implementation of SPH manifestly conserves energy and entropy in regions free of dissipation, while allowing for fully adaptive smoothing lengths. Gravitational forces are computed with a hierarchical multipole expansion, which can optionally be applied in the form of a TreePM algorithm, where only short-range forces are computed with the 'tree' method while long-range forces are determined with Fourier techniques. Time integration is based on a quasi-symplectic scheme where long-range and short-range forces can be integrated with different time-steps. Individual and adaptive short-range time-steps may also be employed. The domain decomposition used in the parallelization algorithm is based on a space-filling curve, resulting in high flexibility and tree force errors that do not depend on the way the domains are cut. The code is efficient in terms of memory consumption and required communication bandwidth. It has been used to compute the first cosmological N-body simulation with more than 10 10 dark matter particles, reaching a homogeneous spatial dynamic range of 10 5 per dimension in a three-dimensional box. It has also been used to carry out very large cosmological SPH simulations that account for radiative cooling and star formation, reaching total particle numbers of more than 250 million. We present the algorithms used by the code and discuss their accuracy and performance using a number of test problems. GADGET-2 is publicly released to the research community.},

   abstract = {We describe the newly written code GADGET which is suitable both for cosmological simulations of structure formation and for the simulation of interacting galaxies. GADGET evolves self-gravitating collisionless fluids with the traditional N-body approach, and a collisional gas by smoothed particle hydrodynamics. Along with the serial version of the code, we discuss a parallel version that has been designed to run on massively parallel supercomputers with distributed memory. While both versions use a tree algorithm to compute gravitational forces, the serial version of GADGET can optionally employ the special-purpose hardware GRAPE instead of the tree. Periodic boundary conditions are supported by means of an Ewald summation technique. The code uses individual and adaptive timesteps for all particles, and it combines this with a scheme for dynamic tree updates. Due to its Lagrangian nature, GADGET thus allows a very large dynamic range to be bridged, 7 both in space and time. So far, GADGET has been successfully used to run simulations with up to 7.5 3 10 particles, including cosmological studies of large-scale structure formation, high-resolution simulations of the formation of clusters of galaxies, as well as workstation-sized problems of interacting galaxies. In this study, we detail the numerical algorithms employed, and show various tests of the code. We publicly release both the serial and the massively parallel version of the code.},

Important examples of this are the motion of stars in galaxies, ions in hot gas plasmas, electrons in semiconductor devices, and atoms in solids and liquids. The behavior of the system is studied by programming into the computer a model of the system and then performing experiments with this model. New scientific insight is obtained by observing such computer experiments, often for controlled conditions that are not accessible in the laboratory. Computer Simulation using Particles deals with the simulation of systems by following the motion of their constituent particles. This book provides an introduction to simulation using particles based on the NGP, CIC, and P3M algorithms and the programming principles that assist with the preparations of large simulation programs based on the OLYMPUS methodology. It also includes case study examples in the fields of astrophysics, plasmas, semiconductors, and ionic solids as well as more detailed mathematical treatment of the models, such as their errors, dispersion, and optimization.This resource will help you understand how engineering design can be assisted by the ability to predict performance using the computer model before embarking on costly and time-consuming manufacture.},

   abstract = {Until recently the gravitational N-body problem has been modelled numerically either by direct integration, in which the computation needed increases as N2, or by an iterative potential method in which the number of operations grows as N log N. Here we describe a novel method of directly calculating the force on N bodies that grows only as N log N. The technique uses a tree-structured hierarchical subdivision of space into cubic cells, each of which is recursively divided into eight subcells whenever more than one particle is found to occupy the same cell. This tree is constructed anew at every time step, avoiding ambiguity and tangling. Advantages over potential-solving codes are: Accurate local interactions; freedom from geometrical assumptions and restrictions; and applicability to a wide class of systems, including (proto-)planetary, stellar, galactic and cosmological ones. Advantages over previous hierarchical tree-codes include simplicity and the possibility of rigorous analysis of error. Although we concentrate here on stellar dynamical applications, our techniques of efficiently handling a large number of long-range interactions and concentrating computational effort where most needed have potential applications in other areas of astrophysics as well. © 1986 Nature Publishing Group.},

   abstract = {The cold dark matter model has become the leading theoretical picture for the formation of structure in the Universe. This model, together with the theory of cosmic inflation, makes a clear prediction for the initial conditions for structure formation and predicts that structures grow hierarchically through gravitational instability. Testing this model requires that the precise measurements delivered by galaxy surveys can be compared to robust and equally precise theoretical calculations. Here we present a simulation of the growth of dark matter structure using 2,1603 particles, following them from redshift z = 127 to the present in a cube-shaped region 2.230 billion lightyears on a side. In postprocessing, we also follow the formation and evolution of the galaxies and quasars. We show that baryon-induced features in the initial conditions of the Universe are reflected in distorted form in the low-redshift galaxy distribution, an effect that can be used to constrain the nature of dark energy with future generations of observational surveys of galaxies. Computer simulations have been used to blend the giant snapshot of cosmic history provided by modern galaxy surveys into a coherent picture displaying the underlying physical processes of galaxy formation and evolution. The growth of 20 million galaxies in a huge cosmological volume was modelled and it proved possible to identify the unusual formation sites and eventual fate of the first bright quasars. It was shown that large surveys are likely to include features in the galaxy distribution that directly reflect physics in the early Universe and may clarify the nature of the mysterious dark energy driving its current accelerated expansion. The cover shows the distribution of dark matter in a slice of thickness 60 million lightyears through the simulated universe.},

   abstract = {Predicting structural properties of dark matter haloes is one of the fundamental goals of modern cosmology. We use the suite of MultiDark cosmological simulations to study the evolution of dark matter halo density profiles, concentrations, and velocity anisotropies. We find that in order to understand the structure of dark matter haloes and to make 1-2 per cent accurate predictions for density profiles, one needs to realize that halo concentration is more complex than the ratio of the virial radius to the core radius in the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile. For massive haloes, the average density profile is far from the NFW shape and the concentration is defined by both the core radius and the shape parameter α in the Einasto approximation. We show that haloes progress through three stages of evolution. They start as rare density peaks and experience fast and nearly radial infall that brings mass closer to the centre, producing a highly concentrated halo. Here, the halo concentration increases with increasing halo mass and the concentration is defined by the a parameter with a nearly constant core radius. Later haloes slide into the plateau regime where the accretion becomes less radial, but frequent mergers still affect even the central region. At this stage, the concentration does not depend on halo mass. Once the rate of accretion and merging slows down, haloes move into the domain of declining concentration-mass relation because new accretion piles up mass close to the virial radius while the core radius is staying constant. Accurate analytical fits are provided.},

   abstract = {Lambda Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM) is now the standard theory of structure formation in the universe. We present the first results from the new Bolshoi dissipationless cosmological ΛCDM simulation that uses cosmological parameters favored by current observations. The Bolshoi simulation was run in a volume 250 h -1Mpc on a side using 8 billion particles with mass and force resolution adequate to follow subhalos down to the completeness limit of V circ = 50kms-1 maximum circular velocity. Using merger trees derived from analysis of 180 stored time steps we find the circular velocities of satellites before they fall into their host halos. Using excellent statistics of halos and subhalos (10 million at every moment and 50 million over the whole history) we present accurate approximations for statistics such as the halo mass function, the concentrations for distinct halos and subhalos, the abundance of halos as a function of their circular velocity, and the abundance and the spatial distribution of subhalos. We find that at high redshifts the concentration falls to a minimum value of about 4.0 and then rises for higher values of halo mass - a new result. We present approximations for the velocity and mass functions of distinct halos as a function of redshift. We find that while the Sheth-Tormen (ST) approximation for the mass function of halos found by spherical overdensity is quite accurate at low redshifts, the ST formula overpredicts the abundance of halos by nearly an order of magnitude by z = 10. We find that the number of subhalos scales with the circular velocity of the host halo as V 1/2host, and that subhalos have nearly the same radial distribution as dark matter particles at radii 0.3-2 times the host halo virial radius. The subhalo velocity function N(> V sub) scales as V -3circ. Combining the results of Bolshoi and Via Lactea-II simulations, we find that inside the virial radius of halos with the number of satellites is N(> V sub) = (V sub/58 km s-1)-3 for satellite circular velocities in the range 4 km s-1 < V sub < 150 km s-1. © 2011.

The highest resolution simulation, Illustris-1, covers a volume of (106.5 Mpc)3, has a dark mass resolution of 6.26 × 106M⊙, and an initial baryonic matter mass resolution of 1.26 × 106M⊙. At z = 0 gravitational forces are softened on scales of 710 pc, and the smallest hydrodynamical gas cells have an extent of 48 pc. We follow the dynamical evolution of 2 × 18203 resolution elements and in addition passively evolve 18203 Monte Carlo tracer particles reaching a total particle count of more than 18 billion. The galaxy formation model includes: Primordial and metal-line cooling with self-shielding corrections, stellar evolution, stellar feedback, gas recycling, chemical enrichment, supermassive black hole growth, and feedback from active galactic nuclei. Here we describe the simulation suite, and contrast basic predictions of our model for the present-day galaxy population with observations of the local universe. At z = 0 our simulation volume contains about 40 000 well-resolved galaxies covering a diverse range of morphologies and colours including early-type, late-type and irregular galaxies. The simulation reproduces reasonably well the cosmic star formation rate density, the galaxy luminosity function, and baryon conversion efficiency at z = 0. It also qualitatively captures the impact of galaxy environment on the red fractions of galaxies. The internal velocity structure of selected well-resolved disc galaxies obeys the stellar and baryonic Tully-Fisher relation together with flat circular velocity curves. In the well-resolved regime, the simulation reproduces the observed mix of early-type and late-type galaxies. Our model predicts a halo mass dependent impact of baryonic effects on the halo mass function and the masses of haloes caused by feedback from supernova and active galactic nuclei.},

   abstract = {WMAP precision data enables accurate testing of cosmological models. We find that the emerging standard model of cosmology, a flat Lambda-dominated universe seeded by nearly scale-invariant adiabatic Gaussian fluctuations, fits the WMAP data. With parameters fixed only by WMAP data, we can fit finer scale CMB measurements and measurements of large scle structure (galaxy surveys and the Lyman alpha forest). This simple model is also consistent with a host of other astronomical measurements. We then fit the model parameters to a combination of WMAP data with other finer scale CMB experiments (ACBAR and CBI), 2dFGRS measurements and Lyman alpha forest data to find the model's best fit cosmological parameters: h=0.71+0.04-0.03, Omega_b h^2=0.0224+-0.0009, Omega_m h^2=0.135+0.008-0.009, tau=0.17+-0.06, n_s(0.05/Mpc)=0.93+-0.03, and sigma_8=0.84+-0.04. WMAP's best determination of tau=0.17+-0.04 arises directly from the TE data and not from this model fit, but they are consistent. These parameters imply that the age of the universe is 13.7+-0.2 Gyr. The data favors but does not require a slowly varying spectral index. By combining WMAP data with other astronomical data sets, we constrain the geometry of the universe, Omega_tot = 1.02 +- 0.02, the equation of state of the dark energy w < -0.78 (95% confidence limit assuming w >= -1), and the energy density in stable neutrinos, Omega_nu h^2 < 0.0076 (95% confidence limit). For 3 degenerate neutrino species, this limit implies that their mass is less than 0.23 eV (95% confidence limit). The WMAP detection of early reionization rules out warm dark matter.},

Assuming that the primordial fluctuations are adiabatic with a power law spectrum, the WMAP data_alone_ require dark matter, and favor a spectral index that is significantly less than the Harrison-Zel'dovich-Peebles scale-invariant spectrum (n_s=1, r=0). Models that suppress large-scale power through a running spectral index or a large-scale cut-off in the power spectrum are a better fit to the WMAP and small scale CMB data than the power-law LCDM model; however, the improvement in the fit to the WMAP data is only Delta chi^2 = 3 for 1 extra degree of freedom. The combination of WMAP and other astronomical data yields significant constraints on the geometry of the universe, the equation of state of the dark energy, the gravitational wave energy density, and neutrino properties.

   abstract = {The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) 5-year data provide stringent limits on deviations from the minimal, six-parameter A cold dark matter model. We report these limits and use them to constrain the physics of cosmic inflation via Gaussianity, adiabaticity, the power spectrum of primordial fluctuations, gravitational waves, and spatial curvature. We also constrain models of dark energy via its equation of state, parity-violating interaction, and neutrino properties, such as mass and the number of species. We detect no convincing deviations from the minimal model. The six parameters and the corresponding 68% uncertainties, derived from the WMAP data combined with the distance measurements from the Type Ia supernovae (SN) and the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) in the distribution of galaxies, are: Ω bh2 = 0.02267+0.00058-0.00059, Ωch2 = 0.1131 ±0.0034, ΩA = 0.726=0.015, ns = 0.960 ± 0.013, x = 0.084 ± 0.016, and Δ2R = (2.445 ± 0.096) x 10-9 at k = 0.002MpC-1. From these, we derive σ8 = 0.812 ± 0.026, H0 = 70.5 ± Ukms-1 Mpc-1, Ωc = 0.0456 ± 0.0015, Ωc = 0.228 ± 0.013, Ωmh2 = 0.1358+0.0037-0.0036, Zreion = 10.9 ± 1.4, and t0 = 13.72 ± 0.12 Gyr. With the WMAP data combined with BAO and SN, we find the limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio r < 0.22 (95% CL), and that ns > 1 is disfavored even when gravitational waves are included, which constrains the models of inflation that can produce significant gravitational waves, such as chaotic or power-law inflation models, or a blue spectrum, such as hybrid inflation models. We obtain tight, simultaneous limits on the (constant) equation of state of dark energy and the spatial curvature of the universe: -0.14 < 1 + w < 0.12 (95% CL) and-0.0179 < Ω < 0.0081 (95% CL). We provide a set of WMAP distance priors, to test a variety of dark energy models with spatial curvature. We test a timedependent w with a present value constrained as -0.33 < 1 + w0 < 0.21 (95% CL). Temperature and dark matter fluctuations are found to obey the adiabatic relation to within 8.9% and 2.1% for the axion-type and curvaton-type dark matter, respectively. The power spectra of TB and EB correlations constrain a parity-violating interaction, which rotates the polarization angle and converts E to B. The polarization angle could not be rotated more than -5?9 < Δα < 2?4 (95% CL) between the decoupling and the present epoch. We find the limit on the total mass of massive neutrinos of Σ mv < 0.67 eV (95% CL), which is free from the uncertainty in the normalization of the large-scale structure data. The number of relativistic degrees of freedom (dof), expressed in units of the effective number of neutrino species, is constrained as N eff = 4.4 ±1.5 (68%), consistent with the standard value of 3.04. Finally, quantitative limits on physically-motivated primordial non-Gaussianity parameters are -9 <flocalNL < 111 (95% CL) and-151 < fequailNL < 253 (95% CL) for the local and equilateral models, respectively. © 2009.

   abstract = {The combination of seven-year data from WMAP and improved astrophysical data rigorously tests the standard cosmological model and places new constraints on its basic parameters and extensions. By combining the WMAP data with the latest distance measurements from the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the distribution of galaxies and the Hubble constant (H0) measurement, we determine the parameters of the simplest six-parameter ACDM model. The power-law index of the primordial power spectrum is ns = 0.968 ± 0.012 (68% CL) for this data combination, a measurement that excludes the Harrison-Zel'dovich- Peebles spectrum by 99.5% CL. The other parameters, including those beyond the minimal set, are also consistent with, and improved from, the five-year results. We find no convincing deviations from the minimal model. The seven-year temperature power spectrum gives a better determination of the third acoustic peak, which results in a better determination of the redshift of the matter-radiation equality epoch. Notable examples of improved parameters are the total mass of neutrinos, Σmν < 0.58 eV (95% CL), and the effective number of neutrino species, Neff = 4.34 +0.86-0.88 (68% CL), which benefit from better determinations of the third peak and H0. The limit on a constant dark energy equation of state parameter from WMAP+BAO+H0, without high-redshift Type Ia supernovae, is ω = -1.10 ± 0.14 (68% CL). We detect the effect of primordial helium on the temperature power spectrum and provide a new test of big bang nucleosynthesis by measuring Yp = 0.326 ±0.075 (68% CL). We detect, and show on the map for the first time, the tangential and radial polarization patterns around hot and cold spots of temperature fluctuations, an important test of physical processes at z = 1090 and the dominance of adiabatic scalar fluctuations. The seven-year polarization data have significantly improved: we now detect the temperature-E-mode polarization cross power spectrum at 21σ, compared with 13σ from the five-year data. With the seven-year temperature-B-mode cross power spectrum, the limit on a rotation of the polarization plane due to potential parity-violating effects has improved by 38% to Δα = - 1°.1 ± 1°.4(statistical) ± 1°.5(systematic) (68% CL). We report significant detections of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect at the locations of known clusters of galaxies. The measured SZ signal agrees well with the expected signal from the X-ray data on a cluster-by-cluster basis. However, it is a factor of 0.5-0.7 times the predictions from "universal profile" of Arnaud et al, analytical models, and hydrodynamical simulations. We find, for the first time in the SZ effect, a significant difference between the cooling-flow and non-cooling-flow clusters (or relaxed and non-relaxed clusters), which can explain some of the discrepancy. This lower amplitude is consistent with the lower-than-theoretically expected SZ power spectrum recently measured by the South Pole Telescope Collaboration. © 2011.

   abstract = {We present cosmological parameter constraints based on the final nine-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) data, in conjunction with a number of additional cosmological data sets. The WMAP data alone, and in combination, continue to be remarkably well fit by a six-parameter ΛCDM model. When WMAP data are combined with measurements of the high-l cosmic microwave background anisotropy, the baryon acoustic oscillation scale, and the Hubble constant, the matter and energy densities, Ωb h 2, Ωc h 2, and ΩΛ, are each determined to a precision of ∼1.5%. The amplitude of the primordial spectrum is measured to within 3%, and there is now evidence for a tilt in the primordial spectrum at the 5σ level, confirming the first detection of tilt based on the five-year WMAP data. At the end of the WMAP mission, the nine-year data decrease the allowable volume of the six-dimensional ΛCDM parameter space by a factor of 68,000 relative to pre-WMAP measurements. We investigate a number of data combinations and show that their ΛCDM parameter fits are consistent. New limits on deviations from the six-parameter model are presented, for example: the fractional contribution of tensor modes is limited to r < 0.13 (95% CL); the spatial curvature parameter is limited to ; the summed mass of neutrinos is limited to ∑m ν < 0.44 eV (95% CL); and the number of relativistic species is found to lie within N eff = 3.84 ± 0.40, when the full data are analyzed. The joint constraint on N eff and the primordial helium abundance, Y He, agrees with the prediction of standard big bang nucleosynthesis. We compare recent Planck measurements of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect with our seven-year measurements, and show their mutual agreement. Our analysis of the polarization pattern around temperature extrema is updated. This confirms a fundamental prediction of the standard cosmological model and provides a striking illustration of acoustic oscillations and adiabatic initial conditions in the early universe. © 2013.

   abstract = {This paper presents cosmological results based on full-mission Planck observations of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. Our results are in very good agreement with the 2013 analysis of the Planck nominal-mission temperature data, but with increased precision. The temperature and polarization power spectra are consistent with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter ΛCDM cosmology with a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted "base ΛCDM" in this paper). From the Planck temperature data combined with Planck lensing, for this cosmology we find a Hubble constant, H0 = (67.8 ± 0.9) km s-1Mpc-1, a matter density parameter Ωm = 0.308 ± 0.012, and a tilted scalar spectral index with ns = 0.968 ± 0.006, consistent with the 2013 analysis. Note that in this abstract we quote 68% confidence limits on measured parameters and 95% upper limits on other parameters. We present the first results of polarization measurements with the Low Frequency Instrument at large angular scales. Combined with the Planck temperature and lensing data, these measurements give a reionization optical depth of τ = 0.066 ± 0.016, corresponding to a reionization redshift of \hbox\{$z-\{\rm re\}=8.8\{+1.7\}-\{-1.4\}$\}. These results are consistent with those from WMAP polarization measurements cleaned for dust emission using 353-GHz polarization maps from the High Frequency Instrument. We find no evidence for any departure from base ΛCDM in the neutrino sector of the theory; for example, combining Planck observations with other astrophysical data we find Neff = 3.15 ± 0.23 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, consistent with the value Neff = 3.046 of the Standard Model of particle physics. The sum of neutrino masses is constrained to â'mν < 0.23 eV. The spatial curvature of our Universe is found to be very close to zero, with | ΩK | < 0.005. Adding a tensor component as a single-parameter extension to base ΛCDM we find an upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r0.002< 0.11, consistent with the Planck 2013 results and consistent with the B-mode polarization constraints from a joint analysis of BICEP2, Keck Array, and Planck (BKP) data. Adding the BKP B-mode data to our analysis leads to a tighter constraint of r0.002 < 0.09 and disfavours inflationarymodels with a V(φ) φ2 potential. The addition of Planck polarization data leads to strong constraints on deviations from a purely adiabatic spectrum of fluctuations. We find no evidence for any contribution from isocurvature perturbations or from cosmic defects. Combining Planck data with other astrophysical data, including Type Ia supernovae, the equation of state of dark energy is constrained to w =-1.006 ± 0.045, consistent with the expected value for a cosmological constant. The standard big bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the helium and deuterium abundances for the best-fit Planck base ΛCDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. We also constraints on annihilating dark matter and on possible deviations from the standard recombination history. In neither case do we find no evidence for new physics. The Planck results for base ΛCDM are in good agreement with baryon acoustic oscillation data and with the JLA sample of Type Ia supernovae. However, as in the 2013 analysis, the amplitude of the fluctuation spectrum is found to be higher than inferred from some analyses of rich cluster counts and weak gravitational lensing. We show that these tensions cannot easily be resolved with simple modifications of the base ΛCDM cosmology. Apart from these tensions, the base ΛCDM cosmology provides an excellent description of the Planck CMB observations and many other astrophysical data sets.},

   abstract = {We present cosmological parameter results from the final full-mission Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies, combining information from the temperature and polarization maps and the lensing reconstruction. Compared to the 2015 results, improved measurements of large-scale polarization allow the reionization optical depth to be measured with higher precision, leading to significant gains in the precision of other correlated parameters. Improved modelling of the small-scale polarization leads to more robust constraints on many parameters, with residual modelling uncertainties estimated to affect them only at the 0.5σ level. We find good consistency with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter ΛCDM cosmology having a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted "base ΛCDM"in this paper), from polarization, temperature, and lensing, separately and in combination. A combined analysis gives dark matter density ωch2 = 0.120 ± 0.001, baryon density ωbh2 = 0.0224 ± 0.0001, scalar spectral index ns = 0.965 ± 0.004, and optical depth τ = 0.054 ± 0.007 (in this abstract we quote 68% confidence regions on measured parameters and 95% on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is measured to 0.03% precision, with 100θ∗ = 1.0411 ± 0.0003. These results are only weakly dependent on the cosmological model and remain stable, with somewhat increased errors, in many commonly considered extensions. Assuming the base-ΛCDM cosmology, the inferred (model-dependent) late-Universe parameters are: Hubble constant H0 = (67.4 ± 0.5) km s-1 Mpc-1; matter density parameter ωm = 0.315 ± 0.007; and matter fluctuation amplitude σ8 = 0.811 ± 0.006. We find no compelling evidence for extensions to the base-ΛCDM model. Combining with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements (and considering single-parameter extensions) we constrain the effective extra relativistic degrees of freedom to be Neff = 2.99 ± 0.17, in agreement with the Standard Model prediction Neff = 3.046, and find that the neutrino mass is tightly constrained to mν < 0.12 eV. The CMB spectra continue to prefer higher lensing amplitudes than predicted in base ΛCDM at over 2σ, which pulls some parameters that affect the lensing amplitude away from the ΛCDM model; however, this is not supported by the lensing reconstruction or (in models that also change the background geometry) BAO data. The joint constraint with BAO measurements on spatial curvature is consistent with a flat universe, ωK = 0.001 ± 0.002. Also combining with Type Ia supernovae (SNe), the dark-energy equation of state parameter is measured to be w0 = -1.03 ± 0.03, consistent with a cosmological constant. We find no evidence for deviations from a purely power-law primordial spectrum, and combining with data from BAO, BICEP2, and Keck Array data, we place a limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio r0.002 < 0.06. Standard big-bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the helium and deuterium abundances for the base-ΛCDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. The Planck base-ΛCDM results are in good agreement with BAO, SNe, and some galaxy lensing observations, but in slight tension with the Dark Energy Survey's combined-probe results including galaxy clustering (which prefers lower fluctuation amplitudes or matter density parameters), and in significant, 3.6σ, tension with local measurements of the Hubble constant (which prefer a higher value). Simple model extensions that can partially resolve these tensions are not favoured by the Planck data.},

   abstract = {We review the progress in modeling the galaxy population in hydrodynamical simulations of the ?CDM cosmogony. State-of-the-art simulations now broadly reproduce the observed spatial clustering of galaxies; the distributions of key characteristics, such as mass, size, and SFR; and scaling relations connecting diverse properties to mass. Such improvements engender confidence in the insight drawn from simulations. Many important outcomes, however, particularly the properties of circumgalactic gas, are sensitive to the details of the subgrid models used to approximate the macroscopic effects of unresolved physics, such as feedback processes. We compare the outcomes of leading simulation suites with observations, and with each other, to identify the enduring successes they have cultivated and the outstanding challenges to be tackled with the next generation of models. Our key conclusions include the following: Realistic galaxies can be reproduced by calibrating the ill-constrained parameters of subgrid feedback models. Feedback is dominated by stars and black holes in low-mass and high-mass galaxies, respectively. Adjusting or disabling the processes implemented in simulations can elucidate their impact on observables, but outcomes can be degenerate. Similar galaxy populations can emerge in simulations with dissimilar feedback implementations. However, these models generally predict markedly different gas flow rates into, and out of, galaxies and their halos. CGM observations are thus a promising means of breaking this degeneracy and guiding the development of new feedback models.},

   abstract = {In our modern understanding of galaxy formation, every galaxy forms within a dark matter halo. The formation and growth of galaxies over time is connected to the growth of the halos in which they form. The advent of large galaxy surveys as well as high-resolution cosmological simulations has provided a new window into the statistical relationship between galaxies and halos and its evolution. Here, we define this galaxy-halo connection as the multivariate distribution of galaxy and halo properties that can be derived from observations and simulations. This galaxy-halo connection provides a key test of physical galaxy-formation models; it also plays an essential role in constraints of cosmological models using galaxy surveys and in elucidating the properties of dark matter using galaxies. We review techniques for inferring the galaxy-halo connection and the insights that have arisen from these approaches. Some things we have learned are that galaxy-formation efficiency is a strong function of halo mass; at its peak in halos around a pivot halo mass of 10 12 M o, less than 20% of the available baryons have turned into stars by the present day; the intrinsic scatter in galaxy stellar mass is small, less than 0.2 dex at a given halo mass above this pivot mass; below this pivot mass galaxy stellar mass is a strong function of halo mass; the majority of stars over cosmic time were formed in a narrow region around this pivot mass. We also highlight key open questions about how galaxies and halos are connected, including understanding the correlations with secondary properties and the connection of these properties to galaxy clustering.},

   abstract = {Modern astronomy has been rapidly increasing our ability to see deeper into the Universe, acquiring enormous samples of cosmic populations. Gaining astrophysical insights from these data sets requires a wide range of sophisticated statistical and machine learning methods. Long-standing problems in cosmology include characterization of galaxy clustering and estimation of galaxy distances from photometric colors. Bayesian inference, central to linking astronomical data to nonlinear astrophysical models, addresses problems in solar physics, properties of star clusters, and exoplanet systems. Likelihood-free methods are growing in importance. Detection of faint signals in complicated noise is needed to find periodic behaviors in stars and detect explosive gravitational wave events. Open issues concern treatment of heteroscedastic measurement errors and understanding probability distributions characterizing astrophysical systems. The field of astrostatistics needsincreased collaboration with statisticians in the design and analysis stages of research projects, and joint development of new statistical methodologies. This collaboration will yield more astrophysical insights into astronomical populations and the cosmos itself.},

   abstract = {Numerical simulations have become a major tool for understanding galaxy formation and evolution. Over the decades the field has made significant progress. It is now possible to simulate the formation of individual galaxies and galaxy populations from well-defined initial conditions with realistic abundances and global properties. An essential component of the calculation is to correctly estimate the inflow to and outflow from forming galaxies because observations indicating low formation efficiency and strong circumgalactic presence of gas are persuasive. Energetic "feedback" from massive stars and accreting supermassive black holes-generally unresolved in cosmological simulations-plays a major role in driving galactic outflows, which have been shown to regulate many aspects of galaxy evolution. A surprisingly large variety of plausible subresolution models succeeds in this exercise. They capture the essential characteristics of the problem, i.e., outflows regulating galactic gas flows, but their predictive power is limited. In this review, we focus on one major challenge for galaxy formation theory: to understand the underlying physical processes that regulate the structure of the interstellar medium, star formation, and the driving of galactic outflows. This requires accurate physical models and numerical simulations, which can precisely describe the multiphase structure of the interstellar medium on the currently unresolved few hundred parsec scales of large-scale cosmological simulations. Such models ultimately require the full accounting for the dominant cooling and heating processes, the radiation and winds from massive stars and accreting black holes, and an accurate treatment of supernova explosions as well as the nonthermal components of the interstellar medium like magnetic fields and cosmic rays.},

   abstract = {abs This review discusses smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) in the astrophysical context, with a focus on inviscid gas dynamics. The particle-based SPH technique allows an intuitive and simple formulation of hydrodynamics that has excellent conservation properties and can be coupled to self-gravity with high accuracy. The Lagrangian character of SPH allows it to automatically adjust its resolution to the clumping of matter, a property that makes the scheme ideal for many application areas in astrophysics, where often a large dynamic range in density is encountered. We discuss the derivation of the basic SPH equations in their modern formulation, and give an overview about extensions of SPH developed to treat physics such as radiative transfer, thermal conduction, relativistic dynamics, or magnetic fields. We also briefly describe some of the most important applications areas of SPH in astrophysical research. Finally, we provide a critical discussion of the accuracy of SPH for different hydrodynamical problems, including measurements of its convergence rate for important classes of problems. © 2010 by Annual Reviews.},

   abstract = {An exponentially expanding Universe, possibly governed by a cosmological constant, forces gravitationally bound structures to become more and more isolated, eventually becoming causally disconnected from each other and forming so-called "island universes". This new scenario reformulates the question about which will be the largest structures that will remain gravitationally bound, together with requiring a systematic tool that can be used to recognize the limits and mass of these structures from observational data, namely redshift surveys of galaxies. Here we present a method, based on the spherical collapse model and N-body simulations, by which we can estimate the limits of bound structures as observed in redshift space. The method is based on a theoretical criterion presented in a previous paper that determines the mean density contrast that a spherical shell must have in order to be marginally bound to the massive structure within it. Understanding the kinematics of the system, we translated the real-space limiting conditions of this "critical" shell to redshift space, producing a projected velocity envelope that only depends on the density profile of the structure. From it we created a redshift-space version of the density contrast that we called "density estimator", which can be calibrated from N-body simulations for a reasonable projected velocity envelope template, and used to estimate the limits and mass of a structure only from its redshift-space coordinates.},

   abstract = {If the current energy density of the universe is indeed dominated by a cosmological constant, then high-redshift sources will remain visible to us only until they reach some finite age in their rest frame. The radiation emitted beyond that age will never reach us due to the acceleration of the cosmic expansion rate, and so we will never know what these sources look like as they become older. As a source image freezes on a particular time frame along its evolution, its luminosity distance and redshift continue to increase exponentially with observation time. The higher the current redshift of a source is, the younger it will appear as it fades out of sight. For the popular set of cosmological parameters, I show that a source at a redshift z 0∼5-10 will only be visible up to an age of ∼4-6 billion years. Arguments relating the properties of high-redshift sources to present-day counterparts will remain indirect even if we continue to monitor these sources for an infinite amount of time.

If the acceleration lasts forever, due to the existence of event horizon, one would have naively expected the universe to approach a state of cold death. However, we find that many local regions in the universe can in fact be protected by their own gravity to form mini-universes, provided that their present matter densities exceed some critical value. In the case with cosmological constant ($\Lambda$CDM cosmology) the condition of forming mini-universe is that the ratio of present density parameters $\Omega_\{i\}^0/\Omega_\Lambda$ ought to be larger than a critical value 3.63. Such mini-universes typically weigh less than $2\times 10^\{14\}$ solar masses, with the lighter ones having tight and compact configurations. In the case with quintessence, the final ratio $\Omega_i/\Omega_q$ of a mini-universe is found to be always larger than $w_q^2-w_q$, where $w_q$ is the equation of state parameter.},

@article{Adams1997,
   abstract = {This paper outlines astrophysical issues related to the long-term fate of the universe. The authors consider the evolution of planets, stars, stellar populations, galaxies, and the universe itself over time scales that greatly exceed the current age of the universe. Their discussion starts with new stellar evolution calculations which follow the future evolution of the low-mass (M-type) stars that dominate the stellar mass function. They derive scaling relations that describe how the range of stellar masses and lifetimes depends on forthcoming increases in metallicity. They then proceed to determine the ultimate mass distribution of stellar remnants, i.e., the neutron stars, white dwarfs, and brown dwarfs remaining at the end of stellar evolution; this aggregate of remnants defines the "final stellar mass function." At times exceeding ∼1-10 trillion years, the supply of interstellar gas will be exhausted, yet star formation will continue at a highly attenuated level via collisions between brown dwarfs. This process tails off as the galaxy gradually depletes its stars by ejecting the majority and driving a minority toward eventual accretion onto massive black holes. As the galaxy disperses, stellar remnants provide a mechanism for converting the halo dark matter into radiative energy. Posited weakly interacting massive particles are accreted by white dwarfs, where they subsequently annihilate with each other. Thermalization of the decay products keeps the old white dwarfs much warmer than they would otherwise be. After accounting for the destruction of the galaxy, the authors consider the fate of the expelled degenerate objects (planets, white dwarfs, and neutron stars) within the explicit assumption that proton decay is a viable process. The evolution and eventual sublimation of these objects is dictated by the decay of their constituent nucleons, and this evolutionary scenario is developed in some detail. After white dwarfs and neutron stars have disappeared, galactic black holes slowly lose their mass as they emit Hawking radiation. This review finishes with an evaluation of cosmological issues that arise in connection with the long-term evolution of the universe. Special attention is devoted to the relation between future density fluctuations and the prospects for continued large-scale expansion. The authors compute the evolution of the background radiation fields of the universe. After several trillion years, the current cosmic microwave background will have redshifted into insignificance; the dominant contribution to the radiation background will arise from other sources, including stars, dark-matter annihilation, proton decay, and black holes. Finally, the authors consider the dramatic possible effects of a nonzero vacuum energy density.},

   abstract = {We construct catalogues of present superstructures that, according to a Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) scenario, will evolve into isolated, virialized structures in the future. We use a smoothed luminosity density map derived from galaxies in SDSS-DR7, Abazajian et al., data and separate high-luminosity density peaks. The luminosity density map is obtained from a volume-limited sample of galaxies in the spectroscopic galaxy catalogue, within the SDSS-DR7 footprint area and in the redshift range 0.04 < z < 0.12. Other two samples are constructed for calibration and testing purposes, up to z= 0.10 and 0.15. The luminosity of each galaxy is spread using an Epanechnikov kernel of 8Mpch-1 radius, and the map is constructed on a 1Mpch-1 cubic cell grid. Future virialized structures (FVSs) are identified as regions with overdensity above a given threshold, calibrated using a ΛCDM numerical simulation and the criteria presented by Dünner et al. We assume a constant mass-to-luminosity ratio and impose the further condition of a minimum luminosity of 1012L⊙. According to our calibrations with a numerical simulation, these criteria lead to a negligible contamination by less overdense (non-FVS) superstructures. We present a catalogue of superstructures in the SDSS-DR7 area within redshift 0.04 < z < 0.12 and test the reliability of our method by studying different subsamples as well as a mock catalogue. We compute the luminosity and volume distributions of the superstructures, finding that about 10 per cent of the luminosity (mass) will end up in future virialized structures. The fraction of groups and X-ray clusters in these superstructures is higher for groups/clusters of higher mass, suggesting that future cluster mergers will involve the most massive systems. We also analyse known structures in the present Universe and compare with our catalogue of FVSs. © 2011 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society © 2011 RAS.},

   abstract = {We use very high resolution cosmological zoom simulations to follow the early evolution of 12 first-generation haloes formed from gaussian initial conditions with scale-free power spectra truncated on small scales by a gaussian in wavenumber. Initial collapse occurs with a diverse range of sheet-or filament-like caustic morphologies, but in almost all cases it gives rise to a numerically converged density cusp with ρ = Ar −3/2 and total mass comparable to that of the corresponding peak in the initial linear density field. The constant A can be estimated to within about 10 per cent from the properties of this peak. This outcome agrees with earlier work on the first haloes in cold and warm dark matter universes. Within central cusps, the velocity dispersion is close to isotropic, and the equidensity surfaces tend to align with those of the main body of the halo at larger radii. As haloes grow, their cusps are often (but not al w ays) o v erlaid with additional material at intermediate radii to produce profiles more similar to the Einasto or Navarro-Frenk-White forms typical of more massive haloes. Nevertheless, to the extent that we can resolve them, cusps survive at the smallest radii. Major mergers can disturb them, but the effect is quite weak in the cases that we study. The cusps extend down to the resolution limits of our simulations, which are typically a factor of several larger than the cores that would be produced by phase-space conservation if the initial power spectrum cutoff arises from free streaming.},

We contrast a model of Cold Dark Matter and a Cosmological Constant (LCDM) with an Open CDM (OCDM) model with the same matter density Omega_m =0.3 and the same Hubble constant h=0.7. Already by the time the scale factor increased by a factor of 6 (29 Gyr from now in LCDM; 78 Gyr from now in OCDM) the comoving position of the Local Group is frozen. Well before that epoch the two most massive members of the Local Group, the Milky Way and Andromeda, will merge. However, as the expansion rates of the scale factor in the two models are different, the Local Group will be receding in physical coordinates from Virgo exponentially in a LCDM model and at a roughly constant velocity in an OCDM model. More generally, in comoving coordinates the future large scale structure will look like a sharpened image of the present structure: the skeleton of the cosmic web will remain the same, but clusters will be more `isolated' and the filaments will become thinner. This implies that the long-term fate of large scale structure as seen in comoving coordinates is determined primarily by the matter density. We conclude that although the LCDM model is accelerating at present due to its Dark Energy component while the OCDM model is non accelerating, their large scale structure in the future will look very similar in comoving coordinates.},

We present the results of a suite of four N-body simulations, two with a ÃCDM initial power spectrum and two with WDM-like spectra that suppress the early formation of small structures. All simulations are run into the far future when the universe is 64 h À1 Gyr old, long enough for halos to essentially reach dynamical equilibrium. We quantify the importance of hierarchical merging on the halo mass accretion history, the substructure population, and the equilibrium density profile. We modify the mass accretion history function of Wechsler and coworkers by introducing a parameter, , that controls the rate of mass accretion, d ln M /d ln a / a À , and find that this form characterizes both hierarchical and monolithic formation. Subhalo decay rates are exponential in time with a much shorter timescale for WDM halos. At the end of the simulations, we find truncated Hernquist density profiles for halos in both the CDM and WDM cosmologies. There is a systematic shift to lower concentration for WDM halos, but both cosmologies lie on the same locus relating concentration and formation epoch. Because the form of the density profile remains unchanged, our results indicate that the equilibrium halo density profile is set independently of the halo formation process.

   abstract = {Studies of large-scale structures in the Universe, such as superstructures or cosmic voids, have been widely used to characterize the properties of the cosmic web through statistical analyses. On the other hand, the two-point correlation function of large-scale tracers such as galaxies or haloes provides a reliable statistical measure. However, this function applies to the spatial distribution of point-like objects, and therefore it is not appropriate for extended large structures that strongly depart from spherical symmetry. Here we present an analysis based on the standard correlation function formalism that can be applied to extended objects exhibiting arbitrary shapes. Following this approach, we compute the probability excess of having spheres sharing parts of cosmic structures with respect to a realization corresponding to a distribution of the same structures in random positions. For this aim, we identify superstructures defined as future virialized structures (FVSs) in semi-analytic galaxies in the MPDL2 MultiDark simulation. We have also identified cosmic voids to provide a joint study of their relative distribution with respect to the superstructures. Our analysis suggests that provides useful characterizations of the large-scale distribution, as suggested from an analysis of subsets of the simulation. Even when superstructure properties may exhibit negligible variations across the subsets, has the sensitivity to statistically distinguish sub-boxes that depart from the mean at larger scales. Thus, our methods can be applied in analysis of future surveys to provide characterizations of large-scale structure suitable to distinguish different theoretical scenarios.},

A couple of groups, Busha et al. 2003 (B03) and Dunner et al. 2006 (D06), have attempted to analytically define these limits, arriving at substantially different estimates due to differences in their assumptions about the velocities at the present epoch. In an effort to locate the largest bound structures in the universe, we selected the Aquarius (ASC), Microscopium (MSC), Corona Borealis (CBSC), and Shapley (SSC) superclusters for study, due to their high number density of rich Abell clusters. Simple N-body simulations, which assumed negligible intercluster mass, were used to assess the likelihood of these structures being gravitationally bound, and the predictions of the models of B03 and D06 were compared with those results. We find that ASC, and MSC contain pairs of clusters which are gravitationally bound, A2541/A2546 and A3695/A3696 respectively, with no other structures having a significant chance of being bound. For SSC, we find a group of five clusters, A3554, A3556, A3558, A3560, and A3562 that are bound, with an additional pair, A1736/A3559, having a slight chance of being bound. We find that CBSC has no extended bound structure, contrary to the findings of Small et al. 1998, who claim that the entire supercluster is bound. In regards to the analytical models, we find that B03 will identify structure that is definitely bound, but tends to underestimate the true extent of the structure, while D06 will identify all structure that is bound while overestimating its extent. Combined, the two models can provide lower and upper limits to the extent of bound structures so long as there are no other significant structures nearby or no significant dark matter exterior to the clusters.},

Our results support the hypothesis that the majority of current compact galaxy groups will not suffer a complete merger within the next few gigayears, and that some of them (≈ 10%) may even evolve without a single merger. We conclude that no overmerging problem exists in compact groups. RESUMEN Se estudia el tiempo de supervivencia de asociaciones compactas de halos galácticos de materia oscura, obtenidas de simulaciones cosmológicas en un esce-nario ΛCDM, mediante simulaciones dinámicas de N-cuerpos. La evolución de tales sistemas se sigue por 5 Gyr a partir de lá epoca actual. Encontramos que de las 14 configuraciones compactas iniciales solamente 1 (≈ 10%) sufre una fusión total de sus 4 miembros, y el resto aún conservan al menos 2 miembros, aunque hayan sufrido fusiones múltiples. Nuestros resultados apoyan la hipótesis de que la mayoría de los grupos compactos actuales no sufrirán una fusión completa en los próximos giga-años, y que varios (≈ 10%) incluso podrían vivir sin sufrir una fusión en 5 Gyr. Concluímos que no existe un problema de sobrefusión en grupos compactos en la cosmología ΛCDM.},

   abstract = {According to the latest evidence, the Universe is entering an era of exponential expansion, where gravitationally bound structures will get disconnected from each other, forming isolated `island universes'. In this scenario, we present a theoretical criterion to determine the boundaries of gravitationally bound structures and a physically motivated definition of superclusters as the largest bound structures in the Universe. We use the spherical collapse model self-consistently to obtain an analytical condition for the mean density enclosed by the last bound shell of the structure (2.36 times the critical density in the present Universe, assumed to be flat, with 30 per cent matter and 70 per cent cosmological constant, in agreement with the previous, numerical result of Chiueh and He). $N$-body simulations extended to the future show that this criterion, applied at the present cosmological epoch, defines a sphere that encloses $\approx 99.7$ per cent of the particles that will remain bound to the structure at least until the scale parameter of the Universe is 100 times its present value. On the other hand, $(28\pm 13)$ per cent of the enclosed particles are in fact not bound, so the enclosed mass overestimates the bound mass, in contrast with the previous, less rigorous criterion of, e.~g., Busha and collaborators, which gave a more precise mass estimate. We also verify that the spherical collapse model estimate for the radial infall velocity of a shell enclosing a given mean density gives an accurate prediction for the velocity profile of infalling particles, down to very near the centre of the virialized core.},

We implement prescriptions similar to those of Kauffmann et al. (1999) to follow the assembly and evolution of the galaxies within these haloes. We focus on two variants of the CDM cosmology: an LCDM and a tCDM model. Galaxy formation in each is adjusted to reproduce the I-band Tully-Fisher relation of Giovanelli et al. (1997). We compare the present-day luminosity functions, colours, morphology and spatial distribution of our simulated galaxies with those of the real local population, in particular with the Updated Zwicky Catalog, with the IRAS PSCz redshift survey, and with individual local clusters such as Coma, Virgo and Perseus. We also use the simulations to study the clustering bias between the dark matter and galaxies of differing type. Although some significant discrepancies remain, our simulations recover the observed intrinsic properties and the observed spatial distribution of local galaxies reasonably well. They can thus be used to calibrate methods which use the observed local galaxy population to estimate the cosmic density parameter or to draw conclusions about the mechanisms of galaxy formation. To facilitate such work, we publically release our z=0 galaxy catalogues, together with the underlying mass distribution.},

In this paper we present numerical values for these criteria for a range of standard cosmological models. We express these criteria in terms of a density ratio or, alternatively, as an infall velocity and show that these two criteria give almost identical results. To better illustrate the implications of this definition, we applied our criteria to some prominent structures in the local Universe, the Local supercluster, Shapley supercluster, and the recently reported Laniakea supercluster to understand their future evolution. We find that for the Local and Shapley superclusters, only the central regions will collapse in the future, while Laniakea does not constitute a significant overdensity and will disperse in the future. Finally, we suggest that those superclusters that will survive the accelerating cosmic expansion and collapse in the future be called "superstes-clusters", where "superstes" means survivor in Latin, to distinguish them from traditional superclusters.},

This model is based on a simple modification of the spherical collapse model (SCM), and its performance in predicting the limits of bound structure in N-body simulations is compared to that of two previous models with the aid of new software named COLDGaS-- compute unified device architecture (CUDA) object location determination in GADGET2 snapshots -- which was developed by the author. All of these models can be distilled down to a single unique parameter \{\xi\}, here named the critical parameter, which was found to have values of 3 and 1.18 from the previous studies, and a value of 1.89 from the modified SCM. While still on the conservative side, this new model tends to better identify what structure is gravitationally bound in simulations. All three analytical models are applied to the Corona Borealis supercluster, with the modified SCM and \{\xi\} = 1.18 model making predictions that are in agreement with recent work showing that A2056, A2061, A2065, A2067, and A2089 comprise a gravitationally bound supercluster. As an additional test, the modified SCM is used to estimate the mass within the turn around radius of the Virgo cluster, providing results in good agreement with studies relating the virial mass of clusters to the total mass within turn around.},

Proposed metallicity thresholds for planet formation do not significantly affect these numbers. However, the metallicity dependence for giant planets results in later typical formation times and larger host galaxies than for Earth-like planets. The Solar system formed at the median age for existing giant planets in the Milky Way, and consistent with past estimates, formed after 80 per cent of Earth-like planets. However, if existing gas within virialized dark matter haloes continues to collapse and form stars and planets, the Universe will form over 10 times more planets than currently exist. We show that this would imply at least a 92 per cent chance that we are not the only civilization the Universe will ever have, independent of arguments involving the Drake equation.},

We adopt the calibrated star formation and feedback prescriptions from our previous work on reproducing the Milky Way with Enzo, with modifications to the simulation code, chemistry, and cooling library. We then consider the future behaviour of the halo mass function (HMF), the equation of state (EOS) of the IGM, and the cosmic star formation history (SFH). Consistent with previous work, we find a freeze out in the HMF at z ≈ -0.6 or $t\approx 28.1\, \{\rm Gyr\}$. The evolution of the EOS of the IGM presents an interesting case study of the cosmological coincidence problem, where there is a sharp decline in the IGM temperature immediately after z = 0. For the SFH, the simulations produce a peak and a subsequent decline into the future. However, we do find a turnaround in the SFH after z ≈ -0.98 or $t\approx 82.4\, \{\rm Gyr\}$ in some simulations, which we attribute to limitations of the criteria used for star formation. By integrating the SFH in time up to z ≈ -0.92 or $t\approx 55.1\, \{\rm Gyr\}$, the simulation with the best spatial resolution predicts an asymptotic total stellar mass that is very close to that obtained from extrapolating the fit of the observed SFR. Lastly, we investigate the future evolution of the partition of baryons within a Milky Way-sized galaxy, using both a zoom and a box simulation. Despite vastly different resolutions, these simulations predict individual haloes containing an equal fraction of baryons in stars and gas at the time of freeze out.},

We address this question using the well-established Santa Cruz semi-analytic models, implemented within merger trees from the new suite of cosmological N-body simulations gureft, which were carefully designed for ultra-high redshift studies. Using our fiducial models calibrated at z = 0, we present predictions for stellar mass functions, rest-frame UV luminosity functions, and various scaling relations. We find that our (dust-free) models predict galaxy number densities at z ∼11 (z ∼13) that are an order of magnitude (a factor of ∼30) lower than the observational estimates. We estimate the uncertainty in the observed number densities due to cosmic variance, and find that it leads to a fractional error of ∼20-30 per cent at z = 11 (∼30-80 per cent at z = 14) for a 100 arcmin2 field. We explore which processes in our models are most likely to be rate-limiting for the formation of luminous galaxies at these early epochs, considering the halo formation rate, gas cooling, star formation, and stellar feedback, and conclude that it is mainly efficient stellar-driven winds. We find that a modest boost of a factor of ∼4 to the UV luminosities, which could arise from a top-heavy stellar initial mass function, would bring our current models into agreement with the observations. Adding a stochastic component to the UV luminosity can also reconcile our results with the observations.},

However, simulations exhibit persistent nonuniversalities in the mass functions of the virial mass and other commonly used spherical overdensity definitions. We systematically study the universality of mass functions over a wide range of mass definitions, for the first time including the recently proposed splashback mass,       . We confirm that, in ΛCDM cosmologies, all mass definitions exhibit varying levels of nonuniversality that increase with peak height and reach between 20% and 500% at the highest masses we can test.       ,       , and       exhibit similar levels of nonuniversality. There are, however, two regimes where the splashback mass functions are significantly more universal. First, they are universal to 10% at       , whereas spherical overdensity definitions experience an evolution due to dark energy. Second, when additionally considering self-similar cosmologies with extreme power spectra, splashback mass functions are remarkably universal (to between 40% and 60%), whereas their spherical overdensity counterparts reach nonuniversalities between 180% and 450%. These results strongly support the notion that the splashback radius is a physically motivated definition of the halo boundary. We present a simple and universal fitting formula for splashback mass functions that accurately reproduces our simulation data. },

We argue that these spherical overdensity masses are more directly linked to cluster observables than masses measured using the friends-of-friends algorithm (FOF), and are therefore preferable for accurate forecasts of halo abundances. Our simulation set allows us to calibrate the mass function at z ¼ 0 for virial masses in the range 10 11 h À1 M M 10 15 h À1 M to P5%, improving on previous results by a factor of 2Y3. We derive fitting functions for the halo mass function in this mass range for a wide range of overdensities, both at z ¼ 0 and earlier epochs. Earlier studies have sought to calibrate a universal mass function, in the sense that the same functional form and parameters can be used for different cosmologies and redshifts when expressed in appropriate variables. In addition to our fitting formulae, our main finding is that the mass function cannot be represented by a universal function at this level or accuracy.

We present simple analytic approximations that allow us to compare the excursion set predictions associated with spherical and ellipsoidal collapse. In particular, we present formulae for the universal unconditional mass function of bound objects and the conditional mass function which describes the mass function of the progenitors of haloes in a given mass range today. We show that the ellipsoidal collapse based moving barrier model provides a better description of what we measure in the numerical simulations than the spherical collapse based constant barrier model, although the agreement between model and simulations is better at large lookback times. Our results for the conditional mass function can be used to compute accurate approximations to the local-density mass function, which quantifies the tendency for massive haloes to populate denser regions than less massive haloes. This happens because low-density regions can be thought of as being collapsed haloes viewed at large lookback times, whereas high-density regions are collapsed haloes viewed at small lookback times. Although we have applied our analytic formulae only to two simple barrier shapes, we show that they are, in fact, accurate for a wide variety of moving barriers. We suggest how they can be used to study the case in which the initial dark matter distribution is not completely cold.},

We find the analytical predictions for the halo mass function, merger rates and formation times to be remarkably accurate. The N-body simulations used 1283 particles and were of self-similar clustering, with Ω = 1 and initial power spectra P(k)∝ kn with spectral indices n= -2, - 1, 0. The analytical model is, however, expected to apply for arbitrary Ω and more general power spectra. Dark matter haloes were identified in the simulations using two different methods and at a range of overdensities. For haloes selected at mean overdensities ∼ 100-200, the analytical mass function was found to provide a good fit to the simulations with a collapse threshold close to that predicted by the spherical collapse model, with a typical error of ≲ 30 per cent over a range of 103 in mass, which is the full dynamical range of our N-body simulations. This was insensitive to the type of filtering used. Over a range of 102-103 in mass, there was also good agreement with the analytical predictions for merger rates, including their dependence on the masses of the two haloes involved and the time interval being considered, and for formation times, including the dependence on halo mass and formation epoch. The analytical Press-Schechter mass function and its extension to halo lifetimes and merger rates thus provide a very useful description of the growth of dark matter haloes through hierarchical clustering, and should provide a valuable tool in studies of the formation and evolution of galaxies and galaxy clusters.},

The model accounts for the large amount of nongaseous 'dark matter', apparently making up about 80% or more of the virial mass in clusters such as Coma and which may constitute massive halos around large galaxies. At work is a process of self-similar gravitational clustering in an expanding universe. The clustering builds up in hierarchical fashion; the smaller-scale virialized systems merge into an amorphous whole when they are incorporated in a larger bound cluster. Residual gas in the resulting potential wells cools and acquires sufficient concentration to self-gravitate, forming luminous galaxies up to a limiting size. This limit agrees adequately with the masses, luminosities, and radii of large galaxies. On certain specific assumptions, a luminosity function is derived that agrees reasonably well with observation.},

   abstract = {We discuss a new algorithm to generate multi-scale initial conditions with multiple levels of refinements for cosmological 'zoom-in' simulations. The method uses an adaptive convolution of Gaussian white noise with a real-space transfer function kernel together with an adaptive multi-grid Poisson solver to generate displacements and velocities following first- (1LPT) or second-order Lagrangian perturbation theory (2LPT). The new algorithm achieves rms relative errors of the order of 10-4 for displacements and velocities in the refinement region and thus improves in terms of errors by about two orders of magnitude over previous approaches. In addition, errors are localized at coarse-fine boundaries and do not suffer from Fourier-space-induced interference ringing. An optional hybrid multi-grid and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based scheme is introduced which has identical Fourier-space behaviour as traditional approaches. Using a suite of re-simulations of a galaxy cluster halo our real-space-based approach is found to reproduce correlation functions, density profiles, key halo properties and subhalo abundances with per cent level accuracy. Finally, we generalize our approach for two-component baryon and dark-matter simulations and demonstrate that the power spectrum evolution is in excellent agreement with linear perturbation theory. For initial baryon density fields, it is suggested to use the local Lagrangian approximation in order to generate a density field for mesh-based codes that is consistent with the Lagrangian perturbation theory instead of the current practice of using the Eulerian linearly scaled densities. © 2011 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society © 2011 RAS.},

   abstract = {Dark matter subhalos are the remnants of (incomplete) halo mergers. Identifying them and establishing their evolutionary links in the form of merger trees is one of the most important applications of cosmological simulations. The HBT (Hierachical Bound-Tracing) code identifies haloes as they form and tracks their evolution as they merge, simultaneously detecting subhaloes and building their merger trees. Here we present a new implementation of this approach, HBT+, that is much faster, more user friendly, and more physically complete than the original code. Applying HBT+to cosmological simulations, we show that both the subhalo mass function and the peak-mass function are well fitted by similar double-Schechter functions. The ratio between the two is highest at the high-mass end, reflecting the resilience of massive subhaloes that experience substantial dynamical friction but limited tidal stripping. The radial distribution of the most-massive subhaloes is more concentrated than the universal radial distribution of lower mass subhaloes. Subhalo finders that work in configuration space tend to underestimate the masses of massive subhaloes, an effect that is stronger in the host centre. This may explain, at least in part, the excess of massive subhaloes in galaxy cluster centres inferred from recent lensing observations. We demonstrate that the peak-mass function is a powerful diagnostic of merger tree defects, and themerger trees constructed using HBT+do not suffer from the missing or switched links that tend to afflict merger trees constructed from more conventional halo finders. We make the HBT+code publicly available.},

   abstract = {Numerical methods have become a powerful tool for research in astrophysics, but their utility depends critically on the availability of suitable simulation codes. This calls for continuous efforts in code development, which is necessitated also by the rapidly evolving technology underlying today's computing hardware. Here, we discuss recent methodological progress in the gadget code, which has been widely applied in cosmic structure formation over the past two decades. The new version offers improvements in force accuracy, in time-stepping, in adaptivity to a large dynamic range in time-scales, in computational efficiency, and in parallel scalability through a special MPI/shared-memory parallelization and communication strategy, and a more-sophisticated domain decomposition algorithm. A manifestly momentum conserving fast multipole method (FMM) can be employed as an alternative to the one-sided TreePM gravity solver introduced in earlier versions. Two different flavours of smoothed particle hydrodynamics, a classic entropy-conserving formulation and a pressure-based approach, are supported for dealing with gaseous flows. The code is able to cope with very large problem sizes, thus allowing accurate predictions for cosmic structure formation in support of future precision tests of cosmology, and at the same time is well adapted to high dynamic range zoom-calculations with extreme variability of the particle number density in the simulated volume. The gadget-4 code is publicly released to the community and contains infrastructure for on-the-fly group and substructure finding and tracking, as well as merger tree building, a simple model for radiative cooling and star formation, a high dynamic range power spectrum estimator, and an initial condition generator based on second-order Lagrangian perturbation theory.},

The evolution of the fundamental statistical properties of the models is described and their comparability with observation is discussed. Graphical comparisons of these open models with the observed galaxy distribution in a large redshift survey are made. It is concluded that a model with a cosmological density parameter omega equal to one is quite unacceptable if galaxies trace the mass distribution, and that models with omega of roughly two, while better, still do not provide a fully acceptable match with observation. Finally, a situation in which galaxy formation is suppressed except in sufficiently dense regions is modelled which leads to models which can agree with observation quite well even for omega equal to one.},

We find that within a few Hubble times from the present epoch, the baryons will have two primary phases: one phase composed of low-density, low-temperature, diffuse, ionized gas which cools rapidly with cosmic time due to adiabatic exponential expansion, and a second phase of high-density, high-temperature gas in virialized dark matter halos which cools much more slowly by atomic processes. The mass fraction of gas in halos converges to ∼40% at late times, about twice its calculated value at the present epoch. We find that in a few Hubble times, the large scale filaments in the present-day IGM will rarefy and fade away into the low-temperature IGM, and only islands of virialized gas will maintain their physical structure. We do not find evidence for fragmentation of the diffuse IGM at later times. More than 99% of the gas mass will maintain a steady ionization fraction above 80% within a few Hubble times. The diffuse IGM will get extremely cold and dilute but remain highly ionized, as its recombination time will dramatically exceed the age of the universe. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Here we report a cosmological simulation of the formation of present-day haloes over the full range of observed halo masses (20 orders of magnitude) when dark matter is assumed to be in the form of weakly interacting massive particles of mass approximately 100&nbsp;gigaelectronvolts. The simulation has a full dynamic range of 30 orders of magnitude in mass and resolves the internal structure of hundreds of Earth-mass haloes in as much detail as it does for hundreds of rich galaxy clusters. We find that halo density profiles are universal over the entire mass range and are well described by simple two-parameter fitting formulae4,5. Halo mass and concentration are tightly related in a way that depends on cosmology and on the nature of the dark matter. For a fixed mass, the concentration is independent of the local environment for haloes less massive than those of typical galaxies. Haloes over the mass range of 10−3 to 1011 solar masses contribute about equally (per logarithmic interval) to the luminosity produced by dark matter annihilation, which we find to be smaller than all previous estimates by factors ranging up to one thousand3. Simulations of formation of dark matter haloes ranging in size from Earth mass to clusters of galaxies find a universal halo density structure spanning 20 orders of magnitude in mass.},

We show that collapsed halos become spatially isolated and dynamically relax to a particular density profile with logarithmic slope steeper than À3 at radii beyond r 200. The asymptotic form of the spacetime metric is then specified. We develop this scenario further by determining the effects of the accelerating expansion on the background radiation fields and individual particles.

The radial phase-space structure of haloes - characterized at a ≲ aeq by a pair of zero-velocity surfaces that bracket a dynamically active accretion region - simplifies at a ≳ 10aeq when these surfaces merge to create a single zero-velocity surface, clearly defining the halo outer boundary, rhalo, and its enclosed mass, Mhalo. This boundary approaches a fixed physical size encompassing a mean interior density ~5 times the critical density, similar to the turnaround value in a classical Einstein-de Sitter model. We relate Mhalo to other scales currently used to define halo mass (M200, Mvir, M180b) and find that M200 is approximately half of the total asymptotic cluster mass, while M180b follows the evolution of the inner zero-velocity surface for a ≲ 2 but becomes much larger than the total bound mass for a ≳ 3. The radial density profile of all bound halo material is well fit by a truncated Hernquist profile. An NFW profile provides a somewhat better fit interior to r200 but is much too shallow in the range r200 < r < rhalo. © 2005 RAS.},

Superclusters are identified with the ones whose mass M > 1015 h-1 M⊙, the most massive one with M ∼ 8 × 1015 h-1 M ⊙, comparable to the Shapley supercluster. The spatial distribution of the superclusters remains essentially the same after the present epoch, reflecting the halting growth of the cosmic web as Λ gets to dominate the expansion of the Universe. The same trend can be seen in the stagnation of the development of the mass function of virialized haloes and bound objects. The situation is considerably different when looking at the internal evolution, quantified in terms of their shape, compactness and density profile, and substructure in terms of their multiplicity function. We find a continuing evolution from a wide range of triaxial shapes at a = 1 to almost perfect spherical shapes at a = 100. We also find a systematic trend towards a higher concentration.
