//
//  SidebarSnapshotMaintainer.swift
//  PublicationManagerCore
//
//  Actor that owns the background refresh loop for `SidebarSnapshot`.
//  Subscribes to `ImbibImpressStore.events` and re-computes the cached
//  counts after every mutation. The compute itself runs on the actor's
//  background executor, so the main thread is never blocked on a
//  sidebar refresh — only a short hop to publish the results.
//
//  ## Lifecycle
//
//  `start()` is called once from `imbibApp.applicationDidFinishLaunching`.
//  It kicks off the event subscription loop and does an initial refresh.
//  After that, every mutation on `ImbibImpressStore` (fanned out via
//  `postMutation`) triggers a debounced refresh.
//
//  ## Debouncing
//
//  Rapid successive mutations (tagging 50 papers in one batch, a feed
//  fetch importing 200 papers) collapse into a single refresh. The
//  maintainer tracks an `isRefreshing` flag and a `pending` bit: if a
//  new event arrives while a refresh is in progress, `pending` is set
//  and one more refresh runs after the current one completes.
//
